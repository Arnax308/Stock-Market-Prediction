       " 'Southwest Airlines Co., which is facing demands for sweeping leadership and business changes from activist Elliott Investment Management, has named aviation industry veteran Rakesh Gangwal to its board. The addition of Gangwal, the billionaire co-founder of InterGlobe Aviation, which controls Indian budget carrier IndiGo, is the second defensive step taken by Southwest in response to Elliott’s $1.9 billion stake in the carrier, after last week adopting a\\xa0“poison pill”\\xa0shareholder rights plan. His appointment to the board is effective today, the airline said in a statement. “This appointment is part of the board’s deliberate efforts to evolve its composition to comprise professionals with a diverse range of skills and experience in areas critical to Southwest’s business,” the airline said. It’s added eight independent directors, including Gangwal, over the past three years. Gangwal is no stranger to discount carriers and the US aviation industry. Best known for co-founding InterGlobe , which is credited with generating the bulk of his wealth, he also helmed US Airways from 1996 to 2001, and spent a decade at United Airlines Inc. from 1984. He was chairman, president and chief executive officer at Worldspan Technologies Inc., a travel and transportation information services and technology company, from 2003 to 2007. Southwest’s lagging financial performance and insular culture have been focal points for criticism by Elliott, which said the airline has “written off” sources of revenue over the past 15 years that were adopted by rivals, including offering a bare bones economy fare and charging customers for checked bags and assigned or premium seats. Southwest Chairman Gary Kelly and CEO Bob Jordan have had “a stubborn unwillingness to evolve the company’s strategy,” Elliott has said. Elliott also earlier called for changes to Southwest’s board, including adding directors with external airline experience. “Rakesh knows the importance of building a business that has both a distinct culture and enduring profitability,” Kelly said in the statement. Under the “poison pill” adopted last week, the acquisition of at least 12.5% of the airline’s common stock would trigger the issuance of rights allowing existing investors to buy shares at a 50% discount. Such rights held by the 12.5% investor would become void, making it prohibitively expensive for Elliott to expand ownership and also diluting its stake in the carrier. Elliott has built an economic interest equal to about 11% in the carrier, but hasn’t reported its full position in securities filings, Southwest said. Southwest has pushed back at Elliott, saying it already had been assessing possible changes such as premium seating or revised boarding that it would unveil at a September investor meeting. But the airline had to cut its second-quarter\\xa0outlook\\xa0for unit revenue on June 26, saying it was struggling to adapt its revenue management system to changes in travelers’ booking habits. Gangwal, 70, and his family once controlled almost 37% of the Indian airline group. His decision to team up with Rahul Bhatia to create IndiGo in 2005 led to the rise of Asia’s largest budget carrier that’s now worth $20 billion, making it the third most-valuable airline in the world behind Delta Air Lines Inc. and Ryanair Holdings Plc and immediately ahead of Southwest. A subsequent feud and concerns over corporate governance led Gangwal to step down from the carrier’s board and\\xa0pare\\xa0his stake in recent years. Gangwal is currently worth $6.4 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\\n       ',\n",

       " \"Tata Group airlines on 8 July announced that it had completed the harmonisation of the operating procedures across its key functions, including harmonisation of the supporting manuals across all four carriers, reaching an important milestone in the merger of four airlines into two in the run-up to the Vistara-Air India merger and amalgamation of AIX Connect with Air India Express “This is an important milestone in the merger of the Tata Group airlines and we are grateful for the support received from the Ministry of Civil Aviation in terms of timely clearances for the merger process. We are also grateful to DGCA for their continuous guidance, systematic review and approval of the harmonised operating manuals. DGCA has guided our teams with a safety-first change management approach which is congruent with the safety-first priorities of the TATA Group. The live tracker created by the Flight Standards Directorate of DGCA with a dedicated team for continuous monitoring of the progress of the harmonisation process has been instrumental in achieving the challenging task in a time bound manner,” said Campbell Wilson, Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director, Air India. Over the last 18 months, a team of more than 100 members have worked to align on the best practices and adopting common operating procedures. The result of this will be two separate manuals for the full-service carrier and the low-cost carrier. Air India and group companies are initiating the necessary crew training to action the harmonized processes, which will be another step in the direction towards building the new Air India and Air India Express. At present, the steel-to-software conglomerate fully owns three airlines -- Air India, Air India Express and AIX Connect (formerly AirAsia India) -- while it holds a majority of 51 per cent in Vistara. Singapore Airlines holds the remaining 49 per cent in Vistara. Over the last 18 months, a team of more than 100 members have worked to align on the best practices and adopt common operating procedures, Air India noted. In another development earlier in June, Air India Express relocated its headquarters to the Vatika One-on-One complex in Gurugram, now sharing the same campus as Air India's headquarters. This strategic move aims to enhance collaboration and synergies between the two entities.\\n       \",\n",

DGCA has guided our teams with a safety-first change management approach which is congruent with the safety-first priorities of the TATA Group. The live tracker created by the Flight Standards Directorate of DGCA with a dedicated team for continuous monitoring of the progress of the harmonisation process has been instrumental in achieving the challenging task in a time bound manner,” said Campbell Wilson, Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director, Air India. Over the last 18 months, a team of more than 100 members have worked to align on the best practices and adopting common operating procedures. The result of this will be two separate manuals for the full-service carrier and the low-cost carrier. Air India and group companies are initiating the necessary crew training to action the harmonized processes, which will be another step in the direction towards building the new Air India and Air India Express. At present, the steel-to-software conglomerate fully owns three airlines -- Air India, Air India Express and AIX Connect (formerly AirAsia India) -- while it holds a majority of 51 per cent in Vistara. Singapore Airlines holds the remaining 49 per cent in Vistara. Over the last 18 months, a team of more than 100 members have worked to align on the best practices and adopt common operating procedures, Air India noted. In another development earlier in June, Air India Express relocated its headquarters to the Vatika One-on-One complex in Gurugram, now sharing the same campus as Air India's headquarters. This strategic move aims to enhance collaboration and synergies between the two entities.\\n       \",\n",

       " \"The Indian gig economy has emerged in the past decade as a powerful engine of economic growth. Since the surge in the startup and new-age platform companies over the past decade, many of them continue to provide jobs to these “gig workers”. These gig workers are typically unskilled youth and benefit both monetarily and in skills through this employment. Large companies play a pivotal role in transforming the lives of millions of these “gig” unskilled workers, as these people get employment and wages commensurate to their tasks, with flexibility in work hours. On the other hand, detractors of this gig economy point to many issues: lack of recognition of gig workers as employees, low and inconsistent wages, no pay transparency or guaranteed income, lack of benefits such as ESIC and PF, no social security or job security, opaque AI-driven employment decisions, long and unregulated working hours, inconsistent or arbitrary commission deductions and no predefined work environments. The gig and platform economy in India has witnessed exponential growth, driven by advancements in technology, increased internet penetration, and a growing demand for flexible work opportunities. The gig economy encompasses a diverse range of work, including ridesharing, food & grocery delivery, urban services, freelancing, and other on-demand services. According to a NITI Ayog report on “India’s Booming Platform and Gig Economy”, the rise of the gig economy in India is changing the face of the workforce. The current estimation for gig economy jobs in India is at 8 to 18 million, which is projected to increase to over 90 million jobs in the non-farm sector in the next ten years. In the next decade, the gig economy in India will be $250 billion or almost 1.25% of India’s Gross Domestic Product. The gig economy is a reality, and large companies and gig workers are responsible for each other’s success and growth, sharing a symbiotic relationship. The interdependence that binds them ensures a series of positive outcomes for both parties. Companies and policymakers should work towards: * Ensuring the long-term sustainability of the gig economy * Balancing economic growth with social equity * Promoting ethical and fair practices within the gig economy The above objectives are being achieved by large companies by: 1) Training and Upskilling Initiatives Unskilled labour in India often seeks opportunities to improve their livelihoods and fulfil their aspirations. Large companies play a crucial role in transforming this workforce by investing in upskilling initiatives. They provide gig workers with training programs, certifications, and access to online learning platforms, equipping them with in-demand skills and opening doors to higher-paying opportunities. Swiggy and Zomato, major players in food delivery, have introduced skilling programs to enhance the professional skills of gig workers. These programs open new avenues for personal and career growth, while also raising the standard of service across the platform. Similarly, Amazon India provides training in safe driving, customer service, and efficient package handling, empowering workers with valuable logistics skills applicable within and beyond the Amazon ecosystem. 2) Using Technology and Promoting Innovation In India, technology has significantly bolstered the gig economy by improving efficiency and expanding reach. Food delivery companies have utilized advanced route optimization algorithms to ensure timely deliveries while minimizing fuel consumption, reducing costs for gig workers. Similarly, Urban Company employs AI-driven tools to match customers with the best service professionals, enhancing earnings for gig workers. With the automation of tasks, Amazon, Flipkart, Delhivery, etc have streamlined tasks and made it less strenuous assignments. By continuously leveraging technology, companies are enhancing productivity of gig workers leading to higher earnings for the workers. 3) Worker Well-being and Better Work Environment Ensuring the well-being of gig workers is crucial for the sustainable growth of the gig economy in India. Large companies are increasingly recognizing the importance of providing a safe and supportive work environment. Initiatives such as health insurance, mental health support, and safety training are becoming more prevalent. For example, Zomato has introduced shelter rest points to combat worker fatigue. Amazon has been working to get the people working at its sites enrolled under two key government programs: E-Shram (Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana) and Health ID (Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana). 4) Side Stepping the Negative Voices The success of the gig economy model hinges on recognizing the interdependence between companies and workers, fostering upskilling initiatives, promoting innovation, and addressing the challenges faced by gig workers. As India's gig economy continues to evolve, a focus on collaboration and shared responsibility will be critical in ensuring its long-term success and positive impact on millions of lives. However, it has been seen multiple times that parties with vested interest prey on this partnership for their own commercial benefits. As India's gig economy continues to grow, a focus on collaboration and shared responsibility by policy makers, governments, and companies will be critical in ensuring its long-term success and positive impact on millions of lives. The nay-sayers with vested interests do not factor in the interdependence between companies and gig workers. The future of India's gig economy hinges on empowering the large companies to be transformative forces, upskilling the workforce, fostering innovation, and propelling economic growth. It is equally important for the labour work force not to fall prey to the narrative of the vested interests and derail the gig economy.\\n       \",\n",

Similarly, Amazon India provides training in safe driving, customer service, and efficient package handling, empowering workers with valuable logistics skills applicable within and beyond the Amazon ecosystem. 2) Using Technology and Promoting Innovation In India, technology has significantly bolstered the gig economy by improving efficiency and expanding reach. Food delivery companies have utilized advanced route optimization algorithms to ensure timely deliveries while minimizing fuel consumption, reducing costs for gig workers. Similarly, Urban Company employs AI-driven tools to match customers with the best service professionals, enhancing earnings for gig workers. With the automation of tasks, Amazon, Flipkart, Delhivery, etc have streamlined tasks and made it less strenuous assignments. By continuously leveraging technology, companies are enhancing productivity of gig workers leading to higher earnings for the workers. 3) Worker Well-being and Better Work Environment Ensuring the well-being of gig workers is crucial for the sustainable growth of the gig economy in India. Large companies are increasingly recognizing the importance of providing a safe and supportive work environment. Initiatives such as health insurance, mental health support, and safety training are becoming more prevalent. For example, Zomato has introduced shelter rest points to combat worker fatigue. Amazon has been working to get the people working at its sites enrolled under two key government programs: E-Shram (Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana) and Health ID (Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana). 4) Side Stepping the Negative Voices The success of the gig economy model hinges on recognizing the interdependence between companies and workers, fostering upskilling initiatives, promoting innovation, and addressing the challenges faced by gig workers. As India's gig economy continues to evolve, a focus on collaboration and shared responsibility will be critical in ensuring its long-term success and positive impact on millions of lives. However, it has been seen multiple times that parties with vested interest prey on this partnership for their own commercial benefits. As India's gig economy continues to grow, a focus on collaboration and shared responsibility by policy makers, governments, and companies will be critical in ensuring its long-term success and positive impact on millions of lives. The nay-sayers with vested interests do not factor in the interdependence between companies and gig workers. The future of India's gig economy hinges on empowering the large companies to be transformative forces, upskilling the workforce, fostering innovation, and propelling economic growth. It is equally important for the labour work force not to fall prey to the narrative of the vested interests and derail the gig economy.\\n       \",\n",

       " '#1. June quarter to see Nifty50 companies post double-digit revenue and profit growth The firms that constitute the Nifty50 index are expected to report double-digit growth in aggregate revenue and profit for the June quarter, driven by some companies in the automobile, banking and finance, and pharmaceutical space. The sample’s net profit is expected to grow 26.4 percent in the quarter, according to the Economic Times, which will be despite the high base of 36.2 percent expansion in the year-ago period. Revenue is likely to grow in double digits after a gap of four quarters by 10.6 percent compared to 6.9 percent increase a year ago. Why it’s important: The three months to June is traditionally a strong quarter for domestic cyclicals but the good show will be boosted by metals and healthcare firms. Geopolitical developments and slow growth in domestic consumption remain key near-term challenges. #2. Market concentration increases in key industries on business growth and acquisition Market concentration continued to increase in India’s key industries as top companies grabbed a larger share of the business in 2023-24 either through organic growth or acquisition, the Business Standard reported. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, a common measure of market concentration in an industry, reached a new high in the just-concluded financial year in industries such as telecom, airlines, cement, steel, and tyers. Why it’s important: Most industries in India have become either highly concentrated or moderately so. The trend is expected to continue due to a spate of mergers and acquisition in recent years and better profitability of larger firms. #3. Adani Group to invest massive $9 billion in capex in first phase of green hydrogen venture The Adani Group will spend $9 billion to build manufacturing and transportation infrastructure for the first phase of its ambitious green hydrogen venture, the Mint reported. Once production gets under way, the business group will hire specialized ships to export what will be the world’s cheapest green hydrogen and its derivatives to Europe and some Asian countries. Why it’s important: Adani’s green hydrogen plans are pivotal to the conglomerate’s business aspirations and crucial to the world’s third most polluted country’s net-zero transition. #4. Regime change in UK could derail Tata Steel’s plans for job cuts at Port Talbot factory The change of government in the UK could be detrimental to Tata Steel’s plans to pare jobs as part of its strategy to shut down ageing blast furnaces at Port Talbot plant in South Wales, the Hindu Businessline reported. Britain’s Labour Party, which came back to power after a decade, has made it clear that concerns around job cuts at the Tata Steel plant will be given top priority. Why it’s important: Tata Steel has been grappling with losses at the UK plant for several years. If the British government takes a hard stance on job cuts, the company will have to extend its losses. #5. Godrej Enterprises Group to map course to unlock growth potential with strategic plan The leadership team of Godrej Enterprises Group comprising the unlisted Godrej & Boyce and several closely held affiliates is working on a strategic plan with the Boston Consulting Group to create integrated and scalable consumer and industrial solutions businesses, the Economic Times reported. The group may consider creating separate scalable business units to drive growth. Why it’s important: Godrej Enterprises aims to tap into synergies offered by business adjacencies to hasten growth after a recent realignment of revenue streams and companies in the century-old Godrej Group. #6. Top startups may see stricter compliance norms on new digital competition regime Over a dozen top startups, including Zomato, Myntra and Nykaa, which command millions of users and large revenues, are likely to face stricter compliance standards under the new legal regime governing digital competition, the Mint reported. Besides MNCS like Alphabet and Meta, these local firms could also be identified as digital gatekeepers with significant influence over the market, according to a study by CUTS Institute for Regulation and Competition. Why it’s important: India is preparing to enact a new competition law to ensure fair play in digital markets, which would set specific thresholds that are expected to cover these homegrown companies. Setting the thresholds would be of critical importance in a country like India that has a strong smartphone penetration. #7. Central government may tweak new electric vehicle policy to benefit legacy automakers India is likely to make changes to its new electric vehicle policy to incentivize automakers that have already made investments in the country, the Economic times reported. The government may potentially consider investments in factories producing both internal combustion engine and electric vehicles as eligible for incentives to add scale and make large investments viable for automakers. Why it’s important: The development comes even as electric carmaker Tesla Inc is still to make any firm commitment on building a factory in India. The policy that aims to hasten local manufacturing of electric cars currently supports only fresh investments. #8. Cash-rich unicorn Zepto to supercharge management team ahead of initial public listing Flush with funds, quick-commerce unicorn Zepto is looking to strengthen its leadership ahead of its upcoming initial public offering in the next 12-15 months by hiring several senior-level employees across various categories, co-founder and CEO Aadit Palicha to the Business Standard. Zepto operates around 350 dark stores across top 10 cities and plans to expand the count to 700 in another 10 cities. Why it’s important: Quick commerce platforms in the country are growing at a breakneck pace, a development that was hard to predict even a few years ago. Finding the right talent for this new business space will not be easy. #9. Auditing overseer free to move against entire firm for alleged misconduct, Delhi high court rules The Delhi High Court has empowered the CA Institute’s disciplinary committee to act against an entire audit firm even when no single individual can be held responsible for the allegations in a complaint, the Hindu Businessline reported. Dismissing a batch of 10 writ petitions filed by partners from firms, including BSR and Associates, Price Waterhouse and Lovelock & Lewes, the court ruled that the committee is free to proceed against the firm as a whole or its individual members, as deemed appropriate, in response to allegations of professional misconduct. Why it’s important: This is a landmark verdict that will compel auditing firms to look closely at their business practices to avoid being censored. It would potentially boost accountability and transparency. #10. Budget could provide funding support to northeastern state to boost hydropower generation The upcoming budget national could unveil funding support to northeastern states for purchasing equity in hydropower projects, the Economic Times reported. The Centre could support equity participation by state governments in hydropower projects in the northeast at 24 percent of the total project equity, subject to a cap of Rs 750 crore per project initially. Why it’s important: Increasing hydropower generation is a key element in India’s green energy transition and reducing emissions intensity of GDP. Financial help to cash-strapped northeastern states would be a welcome move that will help hydropower projects that typically have a long gestation period.\\n       ',\n",

The company regained control of KCM late last year after a five-year battle to recover the copper mines and smelter that were seized by the administration of former Zambian president Edgar Lungu which accused the company of failing to invest to expand copper production. Vedanta said it would also grant KCM workers a 20% salary increase and once-off payment of 2,500 Zambian Kwacha (about $102).

       " 'Bajaj Auto Managing Director Rajiv Bajaj on Friday suggested that the government review GST rates on vehicles powered by clean fuels. At the launch of the first integrated motorcycle Freedom 125 here, Bajaj also voiced concerns about the use of ”unsustainable subsidies” to promote electric vehicles (EVs). Earlier, he, along with Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari, launched the world’s first CNG-run bike in three variants at a starting price of Rs 95,000 (ex-showroom). ”I would call it a suggestion that the government should seriously review GST rates… Just as they’ve done the right thing with the 5 per cent GST for electric (vehicles),” Bajaj said. He said in the major two-wheeler markets in Latin America and ASEAN countries, the equivalent of GST was 8-14 per cent and almost without exception, the GDP per capita was equal to, or higher, in these countries than India. ”So, the aam aadmi (common man) of India is the one who can afford the least out of Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, etc. Then what is the logic, justification of 28 per cent GST,” he asked. According to Bajaj, there is no party happening in the EV segment as of now. Bajaj said the company has played its part by keeping the prices of the new motorcycle below Rs 1 lakh (at the lower end of the range) and was of the opinion that government should also now do its bit with lower GST. ”How can sustainable technologies be promoted by unsustainable subsidies, not only in India but worldwide… we want freedom from all of this,” he said. Terming the launch as a ”game-changer”, Bajaj said, ”Today, the message with the Freedom bike is Tiger Zinda Hai.” Speaking at the unveiling event, Gadkari said India has recently reached the third spot in the global automobile industry after the US and China. ”Our automobile industry contributes around Rs 3 lakh crore in terms of GST and employs around 4 crore people,” he said. The minister suggested that Bajaj Auto should ”make it (the vehicle) a 2-litre tank of ethanol, instead of a 2-litre petrol tank, along with the CNG tank.” He also urged the company to keep the price of the new motorcycles below Rs 1 lakh. This groundbreaking innovation will revolutionise the two-wheeler industry by providing a cost-effective and environment-friendly alternative to traditional petrol motorcycles, the company said. Bajaj Auto claimed that its Freedom CNG motorcycle offers about 50 per cent cost savings by significantly reducing fuel expenses, compared to similar petrol motorcycles. The CNG tank provides a range of 200-plus kilometres on just 2 kilograms of CNG fuel. Additionally, it has a 2-litre petrol tank that performs as a range extender, offering over 130 km of range in case the CNG tank empties, ensuring an uninterrupted journey. ”The Bajaj Freedom 125 showcases Bajaj Auto Ltd R&D and manufacturing prowess. Through innovation, Bajaj Auto Ltd has addressed the twin challenge of reducing rising fuel costs and reducing the environmental footprint from travel. ”The initiative also aligns strongly with the Government of India infrastructure projects of building a CNG network, driven by the need to use cleaner fuels and save foreign tourism exchange,” Bajaj Auto Ltd Executive Director Rakesh Sharma said. The Freedom 125 motorcycle will be produced at the company’s Aurangabad manufacturing facility, Sharma said, adding that the initial capacity will be 10,000 vehicles a month and the plans are to scale it up to 30000-40,000 by the fourth quarter of this fiscal. Sharma added that the company will look at exporting the bike in the next six months. ”Initially, our focus is, of course, India, which is a huge market. But, as we’ve been doing this, six countries come to our mind who have adequate network of CNG. These are Egypt and Tanzania in Africa, Colombia and Peru in Latin America, and Bangladesh and Indonesia in Asia,” Sharma added.\\n       ',\n",

       " 'Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) on Friday announced that it has planned to invest Rs 20,000 crore by 2030 to install nearly 4,000 MW of solar capacity, a top official said. The corporation, created for flood control and development in the Damodar Valley, envisions investment worth Rs 50,000-60,000 crore by 2030 to enhance thermal, pump storage power plants and solar energy, he said.It aims at adding nearly 10,000 MW in thermal and green energy, which will bring its total installed capacity to about 16,700 MW.Of the current 6,700 MW installed capacity of DVC, 6,540 MW is thermal. ”Power demand is growing strong in the north, south, and western parts of the country. We are expanding sustainably with the right mix of thermal and renewable energy, which will keep power costs affordable. We will add 3,720 MW in thermal capacity and nearly 4,000 MW in solar by 2030,” DVC Chairman S. Suresh Kumar said during an interaction on the occasion of the 77th Foundation Day of the corporation. The Kolkata-headquartered corporation now has only 14 MW installed solar capacity and is executing a 348 MW project in association with NTPC.A 250MW/hour capacity of battery storage is also under consideration, he said.Kumar mentioned that DVC has been exempted from coal import due to its power plants’ proximity to the pithead.Recently, the Union Power Ministry has extended a coal import advisory to domestic thermal plants for 4 per cent blending till October 15 to ensure adequate fuel supply during the monsoon season. DVC also plans to ramp up its captive coal mining from its Tubed block in Jharkhand with a separate railway siding for smoother evacuation.”With the dedicated railway siding for loading, we will be able to ramp up production to six million tonnes. We have proposed to the Railways that we would set up the facility at our cost. Due to current evacuation bottlenecks, our output is below two million tonnes. Captive coal is already cheaper, and if Coal India revises the price further, our coal becomes extremely affordable,” Kumar said.The maximum annual production can reach up to nine million tonnes, he said.”The current coal requirement of DVC is 28-30 million tonnes,” Kumar added.The rest of the coal demand is met from the supplies by Coal India subsidiaries. The corporation is unable to bid for a new coal block due to legal hurdles regarding a legacy case, involving a past joint venture with Bengal Emta Coal Mines, the official said.Kumar, who was the former West Bengal power secretary, stated that apart from the 4,000 MW solar power, the corporation plans to install two pump storage facilities in Logu Pahar in Jharkhand (1500 MW) and Panchet in West Bengal (1000 MW).The Panchet project is proposed to be a JV with the West Bengal government.Speaking about dues from Jharkhand, the DVC official said the old dues have come down to about Rs 1,000 crore, and the state is clearing the same.\\n       ',\n",

Besides, the company feels that providing the incentives given to electric vehicles to hybrid vehicles will extend the timeline for transition to emission free mobility. The company, which had increased EV penetration to 6 per cent in the first quarter of 2024, from 2.5 per cent earlier, expects the momentum to carry going forward with three new EV models slated for launch this year, starting with the EQA next week. \"A much more clear roadmap when it comes to taxation on EVs,\" Iyer told PTI here when asked about the company\\'s expectations from the upcoming Union Budget. \"We understand that the Budget may not address the GST topic, but at least if you are able to get a commitment that for the next eight to ten years, this kind of taxation benefit will continue, this will really help brands like us to plan long term and have more commitments when it comes to investments for the EVs,\" he said. For electric vehicles the government has already given 5 per cent GST compared to 48-50 per cent on internal combustion engines, Iyer added. Highlighting investment on infrastructure as another key aspect, he said, \"One of the biggest drivers for our growth has been the growing road infrastructure and intercity road infrastructure that has come up in the last couple of years.\" He further said, \"one big line item that we will see in the Budget is the capital expenditure on infrastructure.

       " 'By\\xa0Faraz Khan and Saket Mishra\\xa0 Technology associated with electric vehicles (EV) is rapidly evolving and by certain estimates total cost of ownership for EVs has already fallen below that of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Some reports suggest that EV sales in India contributed more than 5% of total vehicle sales between October 2022 and September 2023. As prices become competitive and charging infrastructure increasingly available, it is estimated that within this decade EVs could account for more than 40% of India’s automotive market\\xa0and EV sales will likely cross $20 billion in the two-wheeler sector, $1.7 billion in the three-wheeler sector, and $ 16.5 billion in the four-wheeler sector (including buses). The government is incentivizing EV manufacturers by offering various incentives through schemes such as FAME and other production linked incentive schemes. A variety of EV products are being frequently launched in the market across segments. While late-stage funds are entering into partnerships with established automobile manufacturers, early-stage capital is placing its bet on start-up EV and battery manufacturers, amongst other allied businesses such as battery-as-a-service and leasing of EV fleets to last and middle mile operators. Compressing Design-to-Market Timeline With competition heating up, reducing the time required to take new products from design-to-market has become increasingly important. One key factor in this process is ‘homologation’ - i.e., obtaining a ‘Type Approval Certificate’ to ensure that a particular vehicle is roadworthy and matches specified criteria laid out by the government for public use of such vehicle. This article examines the process by which an EV or battery manufacturer can obtain a Type-Approval Certificate for an EV or battery product under the (Indian) Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 (MV Act) and the (Indian) Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 (CMVR\\xa0and, collectively,\\xa0the MV Regulations). As a general rule, EVs expressly fall within the ambit of the MV Regulations. 2W EVs that weigh less than 60 kgs (excluding the battery) with a top speed less than 25 km/hr and power less than 0.25 KW do not require homologation. Such 2W EVs will nonetheless attract liability for defects under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. All other EVs fall within the class of ‘battery operated vehicles’\\xa0as defined under the CMVR. Type-Approval for a New EV Like for ICE Vehicles, the homologation process requires an EV manufacturer to physically deliver to a ‘Testing Agency’ designated by the government, a prototype of the vehicle it seeks to have certified. The Testing Agency shall run such vehicle through a series of tests to determine if such vehicle meets the applicable Automotive Industry Standards (AIS). The AIS govern various aspects including manufacture, functional safety, energy consumption and range measurement of EVs and batteries. Every EV and battery manufacturer has to ensure that their products mandatorily comply with the AIS. Upon successful testing, the Testing Agency will issue a Type-Approval Certificate for the vehicle to the manufacturer certifying compliance with the MV Regulations. \\xa0A vehicle that is not type approved cannot be sold for public use and any violation can result in significant fines and criminal liability as well. Until recently, the Automotive Research Association of India, Pune (ARAI) was the prominent Testing Agency for all vehicles including EVs. In recent years, other Testing Agencies such as NATRAX, Indore, ICAT, Manesar and GARC, Chennai have also gained favour. Notified as late as 2019, some of these Testing Agencies offer state-of-the-art infrastructure allowing for efficient, timely and accurate testing. Obtaining a Type Approval certificate for an EV today can take anywhere between 6 to 12 months. However, with EV manufacturers having the ability to access more Testing Agencies in recent times, the time required to complete the homologation process and obtain type approval certificates for each model is expected to come down. Type Approval For Batteries / Other Components of an EV Manufacturers of batteries and other components for which standards have been notified are required to ensure that such battery or component meet the relevant safety standards applicable to the manufacture of such component. AIS 156 is one such safety standard that was put in place to avoid and reduce battery related fire incidents involving EVs. It applies to battery packs, charging infrastructure and battery management systems. Its implementation did, in the near-term, result in a requirement to re-certify certain components and increase in costs for manufacturers and suppliers. Implementing detailed safety requirements for EV products should only benefit the EV industry in the long term. The Bureau of Indian Standards has also formulated its own standards to ensure safety of EV batteries but these are not mandatory yet. If enforced, it may create further challenges for battery and battery related component manufacturers to ensure compliance with multiple sets of rules promulgated by different authorities. Using batteries that are type approved in an EV does not exempt a manufacturer from obtaining a separate type approval certificate for such EV once laden with such certified battery. In the case of unladen EVs (not carrying a battery), it is not only the vehicle that has to be type approved but also a prototype of the vehicle with the battery installed, prior to such vehicle being sold or put in public use. In fact, where a manufacturer decides to change the type or model of battery used on a previously certified EV model, such manufacturer will be required to re-submit such EV with the new battery to obtain a fresh type approval certificate. This would apply irrespective of whether such a vehicle is installed with a fixed battery or uses battery swapping. In conclusion, it is evident that any efficient ‘go-to-market’ strategy for a manufacturer of EVs, batteries and other components should take into consideration meticulous adherence to standards during the manufacturing process. This will significantly help avoid undue delay in the process of obtaining type approval certificates for electric vehicles. It is advisable for manufacturers to remain keenly involved during every type approval process for their products, such that questions raised by the Testing Agency are answered promptly and defects rectified swiftly.

In the case of unladen EVs (not carrying a battery), it is not only the vehicle that has to be type approved but also a prototype of the vehicle with the battery installed, prior to such vehicle being sold or put in public use. In fact, where a manufacturer decides to change the type or model of battery used on a previously certified EV model, such manufacturer will be required to re-submit such EV with the new battery to obtain a fresh type approval certificate. This would apply irrespective of whether such a vehicle is installed with a fixed battery or uses battery swapping. In conclusion, it is evident that any efficient ‘go-to-market’ strategy for a manufacturer of EVs, batteries and other components should take into consideration meticulous adherence to standards during the manufacturing process. This will significantly help avoid undue delay in the process of obtaining type approval certificates for electric vehicles. It is advisable for manufacturers to remain keenly involved during every type approval process for their products, such that questions raised by the Testing Agency are answered promptly and defects rectified swiftly.

       " 'Carmaker Mahindra & Mahindra has selected ABB India’s PixelPaint technology for its new electric vehicle paint facility, the latter said in a stock exchange filing on July 3. The firm said the technology, which uses a paint head similar to an inkjet printer, will begin serial production in 2025. The share price of ABB India were trading 0.8 percent higher at Rs 8,582 on NSE at 12:46 pm. “Our revolutionary PixelPaint technology can apply large areas of uniform color as well as the tiniest details with complete accuracy, without delaying the production line or the need for manual intervention,” said Joerg Reger, managing director of ABB Robotics Automotive Business Line. “By deploying PixelPaint-equipped robots in dedicated cells, Mahindra’s paint shop will be able to apply finishes such as contrasting roof and pillar treatments on its new line of EVs in a completely automated process,” Reger said. According to the statement, PixelPaint consists of a paint head with over 1,000 tiny, individually-controlled nozzles, mounted on an ABB robot such as the IRB 5500 paint series. “Demand for personalization options has been growing in recent years, and PixelPaint is just one example of how ABB’s transformative technologies are helping to establish Mahindra’s products within the luxury segments,” the exchange filing said. The deployment will make M&M the first original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to use the technology for painting contrasting roofs and pillars, according to the statement.

Moneycontrol was the first to report the sale plans of BSV on December 2. This was followed by a December 20 report that said investment banks JP Morgan and Jefferies had been picked as sell side advisors for the deal. Two other persons also confirmed that the above three suitors have been shortlisted for the next stage of the proposed transaction. They told Moneycontrol that the submission of binding bids is expected in mid-July. With BSV having an established market position in its product segments and strong R&D capabilities, Advent International is expecting a valuation between $1.5 billion to $2 billion for its portfolio company , as per the Moneycontrol report. A fourth person said the EQT led consortium and Mankind Pharma had been more aggressive in terms of financial bids and both parties were the frontrunners but also added that the ChrysCapital combine had more experience in striking deals across the pharma segment. When contacted, Advent International and EQT declined to comment. Email queries to ADIA, Mankind Pharma, ChrysCapital, Warburg Pincus and Mubadala were left unanswered at the time of publishing this article. In May, Moneycontrol reported that a clutch of global private equity funds had evinced interest in the BSV sale process. Mankind Pharma and ChrysCapital had joined hands earlier in the race for Apax Partners backed medical devices player Healthium Medtech, which was eventually won by KKR. Further, in an interview to Moneycontrol in April, Jean Salata, Chairperson of EQT Asia and Head of Private Capital Asia, shared that EQT is considering deploying $5 billion in India this year across sectors like IT, pharma/healthcare and financials. Incidentally, Advent is also exploring strategic options to unlock value in another portfolio company - India\\'s largest rigid plastic packaging firm Manjushree Technopak. A sale process is in the works though Advent also wants to keep the IPO option handy, according to an earlier Moneycontrol report.

A partial exit was given to the founders, the Daftary family. Back then, the deal valued the firm around $500 million.

       " 'BlackRock Inc. is the latest asset manager to launch an exchange-traded fund that offers a way to ride the stock rally — while hedging 100% of the downside if markets plunge. The iShares Large Cap Max Buffer Jun ETF is set to begin trading under the ticker MAXJ on Monday. Using options, it will provide investors with upside exposure to the S&P 500 to a cap of around 10.6% and hedge all of the downside over a 12-month period. Such offerings may appeal to investors looking to tap into stocks’ record-setting rally even as worries mount around the outlook for growth and earnings. At the same time the Federal Reserve is signaling plans to keep interest rates elevated, while the US presidential election adds another potential wild card for markets. As is typical for so-called buffer or defined-outcome ETFs, investors in MAXJ are only promised the full protection if they keep their money in the fund for its entire lifespan, which in this case is 12 months from the day it begins trading. Otherwise, they’ll have to jump into the fund when shares are near that starting level. A year from now, they can redeem their shares or roll them into the next cycle. “They really can almost be viewed as an alternative to cash or Treasury-like instruments in the sense that you’re getting that downside protection, while also the opportunity to capture market growth and upside,” Rachel Aguirre, head of US iShares product at BlackRock, said in an interview. BlackRock plans to issue the ETF in a series every three months, with the next one expected to debut on Oct. 1, followed by subsequent versions in January and April, it said in a press release. The cap will reset automatically at the end of each one-year period. Assets in buffer ETFs have grown to some $46 billion, roughly tripling since October 2022, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. While defensive-minded investors can get elevated risk-free payouts on Treasury bills, Aguirre said that these products would comfortably exceed those kind of returns in the event equities stage a fresh leg up. The S&P 500 gained around 14.5% in the first half of the year, buoyed by solid US growth and soaring megacap technology stocks.

       " 'Qualcomm Inc. has become the new front-of-shirt sponsor for Manchester United Football Club — an attempt to boost awareness of its Snapdragon brand among consumers amid a broader push into personal computing. The California-based chipmaker is paying for a prominent brand position with one of the best-known clubs in the world’s most popular sport. One home game for the UK Premier League team will give Snapdragon as much exposure as a Super Bowl ad, the company said. While Snapdragon has existed as a Qualcomm chip brand for almost two decades, mostly associated with smartphone processors, it’s now being tasked with playing a bigger role. Qualcomm is revving up its efforts to break into the PC industry, an attempt that will require it to take on one of the most successful marketing campaigns of all time: Intel Corp.’s ‘Intel Inside.’ Both Qualcomm and Manchester United declined to comment on the size of the sponsorship deal. Bloomberg reported last year that this partnership is valued at just over £60 million ($76 million) annually. That tops the roughly £47 million paid by the current kit sponsor, German software company TeamViewer SE, Bloomberg previously reported. The three-year agreement includes an option for two more, and gives the football club access to technology that it will use to create interactive bonus experiences for fans, according to Manchester United’s commercial director, Florence Lafaye. The US company has also improved the Wi-Fi service at the Old Trafford Stadium and will help provide an augmented reality “visit” to the football grounds, among other virtual experiences. The club has more than 1 billion followers worldwide, Lafaye said. Qualcomm’s sponsorship of the Manchester United shirt signifies its commitment to raising awareness of the Snapdragon brand, said Chief Marketing Officer Don McGuire. It’s part of a broader and sustained effort to help build the company’s position in PCs and other categories, he said. With greater backing from Microsoft Corp., Qualcomm is rekindling its effort to break into the PC market, which carries much higher average selling prices. It claims that machines powered by its chips will provide significantly longer battery life – days between recharges – along with access to artificial intelligence features being rolled out to this class of devices. Conveying those benefits to consumers who have likely owned phones using Qualcomm’s technology but don’t recognize it as a household name will be key for the company as it brings a more than decade-long effort to fruition. Despite an extended period without industry-leading products, Intel Corp. still has close to 80% market share in PC processors. Its underwriting of marketing for the PCs and the strength of its Intel Inside campaigns over the years have given it a strong grip on the industry. Qualcomm and other companies that have attempted to tailor smartphone-grade chips for laptops have failed to gain significant traction. McGuire, who formerly worked at Intel, says the Manchester United deal demonstrates that Qualcomm now understands that better products aren’t enough and that it will have to invest heavily if it wants to overturn Intel’s leadership in the laptop chip space. “Everyone’s completely in agreement that success is not defined by product alone,” he said. “We had to make up our minds that we’re committed to this business, not just to play, but win.” The launch of the new shirt will start with a video featuring former player Eric Cantona, and the two companies said they’re planning future roll-outs of technology-based offerings for fans. Manchester United will play three games in the US this summer, including one in San Diego, near Qualcomm’s headquarters.\\n       ',\n",

The Reuters story has sparked debates on TV channels, newspaper editorials, calls from women groups, including within Modi\\'s party as well as opposition parties to investigate the matter. Modi\\'s federal government has also asked Tamil Nadu state for a \"detailed report\". Modi\\'s labour ministry, Apple and Taiwan-based Foxconn did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A Tamil Nadu government spokesman referred questions to its labour department, which did not respond. The Reuters investigation found Foxconn systematically excluded married women from jobs at its main India iPhone plant on the grounds they have more family responsibilities than their unmarried counterparts. Foxconn hiring agents and HR sources cited family duties, pregnancy and higher absenteeism as reasons for not hiring married women. Responding to the investigation, published last week, Apple and Foxconn acknowledged lapses in hiring practices in 2022 and said they had worked to address the issues. All the discriminatory practices documented by Reuters at the Tamil Nadu plant, however, took place in 2023 and 2024. The companies didn\\'t address those instances.

All the discriminatory practices documented by Reuters at the Tamil Nadu plant, however, took place in 2023 and 2024. The companies didn\\'t address those instances. Foxconn has said it \"vigorously refutes allegations of employment discrimination based on marital status, gender, religion or any other form.\" Apple has said all its suppliers, including Foxconn, hire married women and \"when concerns about hiring practices were first raised in 2022 we immediately took action and worked with our supplier to conduct monthly audits to identify issues and ensure that our high standards are upheld.\" Indian law does not bar companies from discriminating in hiring based on marital status, though Apple\\'s and Foxconn\\'s policies prohibit such practices in their supply chains. The NHRC said it \"noted the fact that gender equality is not only required in the Indian constitution but the international treaty and covenants.\" State authorities must ensure that all companies follow the norms and regulations relating to labour laws, it added.\\n       ',\n",

The go-ahead by the Drug Controller General of India for WCK 4873 (Nafithromycin) would cap a 25-year-old research programme for the drug, he told CNBC-TV18 on June 28. The R&D programme was aided by the leadership team that has not changed for the past 25 years, he said. At 2.01 pm, the stock was trading at Rs 686.6 on the National Stock Exchange, up 4.99 percent from the previous close. WCK 4873 or Nafithromycin is a drug used for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) and other bacterial respiratory illnesses. The phase 3 trials of the drug took place in December. The study compared Moxifloxacin with Nafithromycin. The test showed that Nafithromycin’s usage resulted in a 96.7 percent clinical cure rate, which was better than 94.5 percent for Moxifloxacin. The pharma company’s investigational drug Zaynich (WCK 5222) has successfully treated a young immuno-compromised patient in the US, which makes it the first case in the country where it has been used to fight a complex infection caused by extreme-drug resistant pseudomonas, the firm said.

India is one of the top consumers of internet data, and with Indian consumers becoming increasingly tech-savvy and digitally inclined, video commerce in the country promises great potential. According to Flipkart Indians have spent over 2 million hours on its video commerce offerings, from June 2023 to May 2024. Tier 2 and tier 3 regions comprised 65 per cent of overall video commerce engagement, mostly in categories like fashion, beauty, personal care, home decor and furnishing. The maximum viewership clocked on a single live commerce video was 1.4 million, it added. \"Video as a format is rapidly gaining adoption, especially among women in tier 2 and tier 3 regions, millennials and the Gen Z audience pan India. The top 5 cities leading the way for Flipkart\\'s Video Commerce engagement are NCR, Bangalore, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Kolkata,\" the e-commerce major said. Three main reasons why customers primarily from below the 30 year age group and tier 2 and tier 3 regions flock to this format are relatability, trust, ease of access and interactivity, Flipkart said, adding that direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands, sellers and farmers also see value in video commerce offerings. \"Flipkart\\'s approach to video commerce has left an indelible mark in 2024, with events such as The Farmer\\'s Alphonso Mango Day Live Stream (establishing direct farmer-to-customer connect), Big Bharath D2C livestream, The End Of Season Sale and Zero Hours witnessing strong engagement,\" Walmart-backed Flipkart said. Citing a report by Redseer Consulting, Flipkart said the short-form video industry in India is expected to create a total opportunity of USD 8-12 billion by 2030, and the overall short-video user base will touch 600 million by 2025. \"Flipkart\\'s video commerce offering is designed to meet an array of evolving needs, with the intention of not only creating an enhanced shopping experience but also addressing possible barriers that exist when it comes to online shopping,\" said Neha Agrahari, Senior Director, Video Commerce, Flipkart.\\n       ',\n",

According to Flipkart Indians have spent over 2 million hours on its video commerce offerings, from June 2023 to May 2024. Tier 2 and tier 3 regions comprised 65 per cent of overall video commerce engagement, mostly in categories like fashion, beauty, personal care, home decor and furnishing. The maximum viewership clocked on a single live commerce video was 1.4 million, it added. \"Video as a format is rapidly gaining adoption, especially among women in tier 2 and tier 3 regions, millennials and the Gen Z audience pan India. The top 5 cities leading the way for Flipkart\\'s Video Commerce engagement are NCR, Bangalore, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Kolkata,\" the e-commerce major said. Three main reasons why customers primarily from below the 30 year age group and tier 2 and tier 3 regions flock to this format are relatability, trust, ease of access and interactivity, Flipkart said, adding that direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands, sellers and farmers also see value in video commerce offerings. \"Flipkart\\'s approach to video commerce has left an indelible mark in 2024, with events such as The Farmer\\'s Alphonso Mango Day Live Stream (establishing direct farmer-to-customer connect), Big Bharath D2C livestream, The End Of Season Sale and Zero Hours witnessing strong engagement,\" Walmart-backed Flipkart said. Citing a report by Redseer Consulting, Flipkart said the short-form video industry in India is expected to create a total opportunity of USD 8-12 billion by 2030, and the overall short-video user base will touch 600 million by 2025. \"Flipkart\\'s video commerce offering is designed to meet an array of evolving needs, with the intention of not only creating an enhanced shopping experience but also addressing possible barriers that exist when it comes to online shopping,\" said Neha Agrahari, Senior Director, Video Commerce, Flipkart.\\n       ',\n",

The deal has provided a partial exit to Creador and Morgan Stanley Private Equity Asia, even as the firm which is also backed by the likes of Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and Multiples Private Equity, looks to ramp up its presence in new geographies. The Jaipur-based NBFC was founded in 1996 and has assets under management of Rs 4,800 crore. Monyeycontrol's Ashwin Mohan caught up for a quick chat with Arun Kogta, MD & CEO of Kogta Financial on the deal rationale & valuations as well as the firm's listing plans in a busy market for equity capital market transactions. Edited excerpts: This is your fifth round of equity investment following the last one in March 2022. What made you pick OTPP, which will pick up a chunky minority stake. It also becomes the second Canadian pension fund to join the firm's cap table following peer CPPIB. We are delighted to have gained the trust of two pension funds investing in our company. This underscores our strong culture, governance standards, and growth prospects. Ontario Teachers' commitment is a significant addition to our investor base, bringing global experience, long-term capital, and a visionary outlook that aligns perfectly with our company's goals. Following the partial exits by existing investors Creador and Morgan Stanley PE and the entry of OTPP, how much stake do the founders own in Kogta Financial? The founders remain the single largest group of shareholders in the company, holding more than 30 percent on a fully diluted basis, and continue to retain operational control of the business. As an NBFC, you focus on the segments of vehicle finance and MSME loans. What are the new product offerings you will explore post the latest fund raise and any new cities or states you plan to cover? We will maintain our focus on vehicle finance and MSME loans, continuing to expand within our current geographies while initiating expansion into new states such as Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh starting in the second half of the year. At what valuation has the current deal been struck? We understand from our sources that OTPP will pick up around 24 percent stake in Kogta Financial for around $150 million, which would imply a valuation of roughly around $600 million. Is that range accurate? Yes, it is a fair range. With such a diversified cap table of leading investors, would you explore a potential IPO in the next 12-15 months? If yes, is a sixth fund raise on the cards before the listing? The expected IPO timelines are 18-24 months, but we can accelerate (our plans) if the markets are favourable. Do you expect M&A and IPO action to continue in the NBFC space? What deal trends are you seeing? Yes, we believe there is robust demand for companies that exhibit strong governance, a solid tech focus, and effective customer engagement. NBFCs demonstrating sustainable growth, consistent profitability, and high-quality portfolios are expected to attract significant investor interest. The segment shows strong growth momentum, which we anticipate will continue over the next 3-5 years.\\n       \",\n",

The approval ratings went up to 97 percent for claims initiated through online channels, according to the report. However, the 6 percent claims that were rejected were attributed to non-disclosure of pre-existing or uncovered diseases, the report said. “This brings out the need for increased awareness and transparency in the industry along with product simplification so that there’s a better understanding between the consumer and the industry,” it said. The study also added that the involvement of both online and offline intermediaries can help turn over the tide and boost approval rates.

While 86 percent of the people studied said they were ‘satisfied’ with their claims experience, 40 percent said they were 'extremely satisfied'. The biggest reasons for such high positive feedback were cashless claims, online channels and minimal paperwork, the report found. The report also revealed that cashless claims offer a seamless experience with lower rejection rates. Reimbursement claims are sought only in cases where the preferred healthcare service provider is not in the network of the insurance company. “However, upfront payment for treatment remains a challenge for many, with approximately 70 percent of reimbursement claimants seeking financial aid through formal or informal loans or breaking their savings funds meant for other life goals,” it said.\\n       \",\n",

       " 'Tata Steel aims at having a minimum of 25 per cent of its workforce made up of diverse groups, including gender minorities, marginalised communities, persons with disabilities and LGBTQIA+ individuals, within the next few years, a company official said. It is one of the first companies in the country to roll out a special recruitment drive for transgender talent, having recruited over 100 members from the community for various roles across different locations, the official claimed. \"Continuing this drive, we aim to have 25 per cent of our workforce from diverse groups in the next couple of years,\" the official said. A total of 113 transgender individuals have been onboarded and posted at various locations, including manufacturing, operations and maintenance, mining, and services. These employees are stationed in Noamundi, West Bokaro, Kolkata, Kharagpur, Kalinganagar, and Jamshedpur. Some of these employees work all three shifts and operate Heavy Earth Moving Machinery (HEMM) at the Noamundi iron ore mine in Jharkhand\\'s West Singhbhum and West Bokaro coal mine in Ramgarh district. \"Tata Steel appreciates the potential of diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) and has a tremendous organisational focus on it,\" the official said. \"In line with this, we renewed our commitment and refocused our approach to DE&I in 2015 by setting up MOSAIC - a platform for pioneering initiatives, diversity targets, and employee-friendly policies conceptualised and executed from the apex level,\" he added. The official admitted that the initial planning stage was challenging due to inadequate knowledge about the transgender community. \"However, we made a detailed plan and implemented it without any difficulty. To date, we have not received any complaint from either side of the employees since the first batch of transgender individuals was inducted following proper training in 2019,\" the official said. On the productivity of these employees compared to the general workforce, he said transgender individuals perform better in some areas. Jaya Singh Panda, Chief Diversity Officer at Tata Steel, said, \"We believe in nurturing a workplace where every person, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, feels valued, respected, and empowered. Diversity is one of our greatest strengths, and continuing this practice is key to long-term success and innovation.\" Speaking on condition of anonymity, a transgender employee at the company\\'s Jamshedpur plant said, \"We feel very safe inside the company as coworkers are friendly, supportive, and cooperative. The company has also developed infrastructure, including separate toilets for us.\" Another trans-female employee from Noamundi lamented that her parents never used to care about whether she ate or came home on time. \"When my father learned about my job at Tata Steel, he did not believe me. He came and stayed with me until I joined. Since then, he calls me every day to check on me,\" the worker said. A trans-male employee in Jamshedpur said his job at the company enabled him to support his family and help with his sister\\'s marriage, something he never imagined possible.

It is one of the first companies in the country to roll out a special recruitment drive for transgender talent, having recruited over 100 members from the community for various roles across different locations, the official claimed. \"Continuing this drive, we aim to have 25 per cent of our workforce from diverse groups in the next couple of years,\" the official said. A total of 113 transgender individuals have been onboarded and posted at various locations, including manufacturing, operations and maintenance, mining, and services. These employees are stationed in Noamundi, West Bokaro, Kolkata, Kharagpur, Kalinganagar, and Jamshedpur. Some of these employees work all three shifts and operate Heavy Earth Moving Machinery (HEMM) at the Noamundi iron ore mine in Jharkhand\\'s West Singhbhum and West Bokaro coal mine in Ramgarh district. \"Tata Steel appreciates the potential of diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) and has a tremendous organisational focus on it,\" the official said. \"In line with this, we renewed our commitment and refocused our approach to DE&I in 2015 by setting up MOSAIC - a platform for pioneering initiatives, diversity targets, and employee-friendly policies conceptualised and executed from the apex level,\" he added. The official admitted that the initial planning stage was challenging due to inadequate knowledge about the transgender community. \"However, we made a detailed plan and implemented it without any difficulty. To date, we have not received any complaint from either side of the employees since the first batch of transgender individuals was inducted following proper training in 2019,\" the official said. On the productivity of these employees compared to the general workforce, he said transgender individuals perform better in some areas. Jaya Singh Panda, Chief Diversity Officer at Tata Steel, said, \"We believe in nurturing a workplace where every person, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, feels valued, respected, and empowered. Diversity is one of our greatest strengths, and continuing this practice is key to long-term success and innovation.\" Speaking on condition of anonymity, a transgender employee at the company\\'s Jamshedpur plant said, \"We feel very safe inside the company as coworkers are friendly, supportive, and cooperative. The company has also developed infrastructure, including separate toilets for us.\" Another trans-female employee from Noamundi lamented that her parents never used to care about whether she ate or came home on time. \"When my father learned about my job at Tata Steel, he did not believe me. He came and stayed with me until I joined. Since then, he calls me every day to check on me,\" the worker said. A trans-male employee in Jamshedpur said his job at the company enabled him to support his family and help with his sister\\'s marriage, something he never imagined possible. Another trans-female employee in Jamshedpur expressed gratitude for the accommodation provided by the company. \"I\\'m happy that my society has accepted me as an individual,\" another member of the group added.\\n       ',\n",

The yearlong probe by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs found no evidence of wrongdoing such as siphoning of funds or manipulation of financial accounts, people familiar with the matter said. Still, it discovered governance shortcomings that contributed to the startup’s mounting losses, the people said, asking not to be named as the investigators’ report isn’t public yet. The findings offer some support for once-celebrated founder Byju Raveendran, who’s been accused of mismanagement by disgruntled investors. Three shareholders including Prosus Ventures and Peak XV Partners, formerly Sequoia Capital India, left the board of Byju’s last year over differences with Raveendran on issues such as business processes and internal controls. The report also ends, at least temporarily, the possibility of any new scrutiny on the company by Indian officials on issues already probed. Representatives of the corporate affairs ministry, Byju’s, Peak XV and Prosus didn’t respond to requests for comment. The report doesn’t directly address whether Raveendran personally is at fault for the governance lapses or whether he is qualified to run the company. The disgruntled investors have sought his removal, citing management and compliance failures. The report also does little to stave off the company’s broader problems. The unprofitable startup’s quick expansion led to a cash crunch and a plunge in its valuation, and it’s\\xa0now fighting multiple lawsuits in India and the US. The probe found that weak corporate governance and compliance practices, along with a change in the funding environment, contributed to its ballooning losses, the people said.

The report establishes that Byju’s didn’t disclose full details of acquisitions with all directors and that meetings to approve such deals were called at short notice.

       " \"Hyundai’s proposed public issue, with the Korean parent offering for sale 17.5% stake in the Indian subsidiary, throws up some novel opportunities. The money raised would go out of India to the Korean parent, and so the effect would be no different from if the Korean parent were to raise fresh capital for itself in India, rather than in London or New York. Repatriation of the capital would take out a max of $3 billion from India, nothing to worry about, either in terms of the impact on India’s foreign exchange reserves or on the exchange rate. The potential benefits outweigh, by far, the potential harm. It Adds to Good Options of Domestic Investors The public issue would be a gain for the Indian investing public, who have been ratcheting up valuations in their investment universe of listed companies, comprising a limited number of investment-worthy companies, and of some dubious entities of the sort that simply insert AI in the company’s name and push WhatsApp messages to all and sundry expounding on the brave new world of artificial intelligence and the fortunes to be made by catching the wave early. Investors would get a chance to own a chunk of India’s second-largest car maker, with access to good research and development capabilities in its foreign parent. Elements of the Indian stock market ecosystem — merchant banks, brokerages, corporate law firms, rating agencies, sundry analysts, investment pools — all will get additional business. That is a transparent plus. Will There Be a Knock-On Effect? The interesting question is, will a successful Hyundai IPO induce other multinational companies to list their Indian arms, taking advantage of the Indian market's red-hot valuations? Will such capital raising add momentum to India’s capital account convertibility plans? Can India develop as a financial centre for companies from Asia and Africa, where the capital that is raised comes from foreign funds, as well as Indian investment pools, with India serving as a site for allocation of capital drawn from India and abroad? After all, this is what happens when a company offers shares and gets listed in London or New York. Getting a Leg Up on China India would, in the process, steal a march over China, whose own financial markets, including the market for equity capital, lag the country’s product markets in sophistication.The Chinese economy is right now struggling to recover from the collapse of its property sector. Real estate served as the principal form of savings for the Chinese, even after the homeownership rate rose to nearly 90% by 2014, many owning a second or even a third home. The illusion that residential property is a form of saving that would not lose value cannot sustain when excess supply finally meets with its reckoning, in the financial travails of property companies that cannot repay loans or complete projects that they have already sold. Right now, the Chinese are saving in tiny gold beads, after the collapse of the property market and of giant property firms like Evergrande.Chinese savings are still waiting to be financialised, which is why American financial majors do not join the chorus of decoupling from China.

READ |\\xa0Everything you need to know about Hyundai Motor's mammoth IPO India’s financial markets are relatively more evolved, except for the market for corporate debt. In the speed of settlement of trades, in guaranteeing settlement, in applying price floors and ceilings in times of extreme stock price volatility, in the number of stocks with individual futures and options, and in the digital underpinning of capital market transactions, India is right there at the global cutting edge. Unlike in the US, where the regulation of financial and commodity markets, as well as of spot and forward markets, is split up among different regulators, India has unified regulation, with government debt being an outlier. Equities, a Preferred Choice Indian investors have been weaned off bank fixed deposits and a policy from the Life Insurance Corporation of India as their preferred forms of financial savings. Investment in stocks, via mutual funds, equity linked saving schemes and direct purchase, have grown by leaps and bounds, to a stage where the market can shrug off coordinated exits by foreign portfolio investors. Capital can flow in and out of India reasonably smoothly, and the International Financial Services Centre in GIFT City, Gujarat, makes the process even more frictionless. All this offers an opportunity for India to serve as a global centre of financial intermediation. Earlier, multinational companies listed their Indian arms out of regulatory compulsion. Now, Hyundai’s share price rise in Korea, after its IPO proposal in India came to light, makes it clear that India would be an attractive place for raising capital for global companies. Will this place an undue burden on India’s currency regime? That is unlikely, with foreign capital flowing in to take part in share offerings in India, along with participation by Indian investors. India’s capital account restrictions apply mostly to residents, not foreign investors. In the interest of extreme prudence, regulation can set limits on how much residents can invest in foreign share offerings. Right now, policy allows an individual resident to take out up to $250,000 for current or capital account purposes a year. The limit for an individual resident for participation in a foreign share offering in India could be fixed at, say, double that limit. While the resident would not be taking any capital out directly, her purchase of a foreign share offering would lead to an equivalent outflow by the issuing multinational. On the plus side, the additional demand for dollars in the forex market for repatriating IPO proceeds by MNCs would spare the RBI the need to purchase inflows to prevent overvaluation of the rupee. Once Hyundai tastes success, and other global companies with or without an Indian presence show an inclination to raise capital in India, the government should stand ready to welcome the move.\\n       \",\n",
       " \"Hyundai’s proposed public issue, with the Korean parent offering for sale 17.5% stake in the Indian subsidiary, throws up some novel opportunities. The money raised would go out of India to the Korean parent, and so the effect would be no different from if the Korean parent were to raise fresh capital for itself in India, rather than in London or New York. Repatriation of the capital would take out a max of $3 billion from India, nothing to worry about, either in terms of the impact on India’s foreign exchange reserves or on the exchange rate. The potential benefits outweigh, by far, the potential harm. It Adds to Good Options of Domestic Investors The public issue would be a gain for the Indian investing public, who have been ratcheting up valuations in their investment universe of listed companies, comprising a limited number of investment-worthy companies, and of some dubious entities of the sort that simply insert AI in the company’s name and push WhatsApp messages to all and sundry expounding on the brave new world of artificial intelligence and the fortunes to be made by catching the wave early. Investors would get a chance to own a chunk of India’s second-largest car maker, with access to good research and development capabilities in its foreign parent. Elements of the Indian stock market ecosystem — merchant banks, brokerages, corporate law firms, rating agencies, sundry analysts, investment pools — all will get additional business. That is a transparent plus. Will There Be a Knock-On Effect? The interesting question is, will a successful Hyundai IPO induce other multinational companies to list their Indian arms, taking advantage of the Indian market's red-hot valuations? Will such capital raising add momentum to India’s capital account convertibility plans? Can India develop as a financial centre for companies from Asia and Africa, where the capital that is raised comes from foreign funds, as well as Indian investment pools, with India serving as a site for allocation of capital drawn from India and abroad? After all, this is what happens when a company offers shares and gets listed in London or New York.

The company has invested Rs 100 crore to set up the washroom automation accessories production unit at Gurugram with an annual production capacity of 2 lakh units and it will become operational this month. \"In the last financial year we were around Rs 200 crore... This year we are looking at close to Rs 280 crore to Rs 290 crore and in FY25-26 we are chasing Rs 400 crore turnover,\" Euronics MD & CEO Viknesh Jain told PTI. He was responding to a query on the company\\'s growth trajectory. Established in 2002, Euronics is a major player in India\\'s public and commercial washroom sector, he said, with growth fuelled by the expansive growth of the country\\'s public infrastructure, commercial real estate, and retail sectors. While initially it catered mainly to the private sector, including several Fortune 500 companies, Jain said in the past six to seven years it has started getting a lot of government projects. Euronics had recently undertaken washroom automation for Ram Mandir in Ayodhya; Yashobhoomi (India International Convention & Expo Center), New Parliament Building, airports across Ayodhya, Mumbai, Delhi, Goa, and Bangalore among other cities, and other smart city projects in India, Jain added. With the new plant coming in, the company said it will be able to fulfill 50 per cent of its average order volumes from the Gurugram unit alone.

       " 'Public washroom automation firm Euronics is looking to double its turnover to Rs 400 crore by 2025-26 with its new manufacturing plant at Gurugram set to become operational to fulfil 50 per cent of its orders. The company has invested Rs 100 crore to set up the washroom automation accessories production unit at Gurugram with an annual production capacity of 2 lakh units and it will become operational this month. \"In the last financial year we were around Rs 200 crore... This year we are looking at close to Rs 280 crore to Rs 290 crore and in FY25-26 we are chasing Rs 400 crore turnover,\" Euronics MD & CEO Viknesh Jain told PTI. He was responding to a query on the company\\'s growth trajectory. Established in 2002, Euronics is a major player in India\\'s public and commercial washroom sector, he said, with growth fuelled by the expansive growth of the country\\'s public infrastructure, commercial real estate, and retail sectors. While initially it catered mainly to the private sector, including several Fortune 500 companies, Jain said in the past six to seven years it has started getting a lot of government projects. Euronics had recently undertaken washroom automation for Ram Mandir in Ayodhya; Yashobhoomi (India International Convention & Expo Center), New Parliament Building, airports across Ayodhya, Mumbai, Delhi, Goa, and Bangalore among other cities, and other smart city projects in India, Jain added. With the new plant coming in, the company said it will be able to fulfill 50 per cent of its average order volumes from the Gurugram unit alone. The unit will create around 200 blue-collar jobs. \"When we started it was more like contract manufacturing but right now around 50-60 per cent of the products which are sold by us are produced by us.

       " 'Bobby Jain has gathered $5.3 billion in commitments for his new multistrategy hedge fund, marking the biggest fundraising haul since ExodusPoint Capital Management’s record debut. Jain Global will start trading July 1, according to people familiar with the matter. Investors include endowments, foundations, family offices, bank wealth platforms and sovereign wealth funds. The premiere caps a busy year for Jain — former co-chief investment officer at Millennium Management — who has traveled the world pitching his fund. He initially aimed to gather as much as $10 billion. But after struggling to hit that goal, he cut client fees to entice investors and reduced his target to between $5 billion and $6 billion. A representative for the firm declined to comment. Even with the revised goal, Jain Global is the biggest launch since 2018. Jain topped fellow Millennium alumnus Diego Megia, whose Taula Capital Management began trading this month with $5 billion. Megia spun out his macro pod from Millennium and received $3 billion from his former employer. Jain has been raising money in a challenging environment, as interest rates remain elevated and deals have slowed to a trickle. New hedge funds also face stiff competition from bigger multistrategy funds with established track records. Despite those obstacles, Jain Global is starting off big — having hired 215 people, including 42 portfolio managers. The firm has seven businesses that will go live on July 1, including an Asia-Pacific business that will essentially act as a multimanager platform and trade six strategies, with the profits feeding into the Jain fund. The firm raised money via a so-called drawdown fund, meaning it will tap the cash as needed over a year. Michael Gelband’s ExodusPoint still enjoys the distinction of biggest-ever hedge fund debut. Yet another Millennium alumnus, Gelband raised $8 billion for a multistrategy fund that began in 2018 and has fixed-income and equity businesses. Jain launched his own shop after leaving Millennium, where he shared the CIO title with founder Izzy Englander. Over his seven years there, he helped the multistrategy giant push into new strategies, recruit, upgrade technologies and develop its central risk book. Millennium’s assets doubled to about $60 billion during his tenure.

       " 'Nvidia Corp. shares fell on Monday, with the AI-focused chipmaker entering correction territory as it extends a sharp recent selloff. The stock fell 4.8% and is on track for its third straight negative session. It has dropped 12% over the three-day slide, putting it past the 10% threshold that represents a correction. The drop weighed on chipmakers with the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index falling as much as 2.2% on Monday. Broadcom Inc., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Qualcomm Inc. were all lower by at least 2%. The three-day drop erased more than $400 billion from Nvidia’s market capitalization, putting it back below the $3 trillion threshold, as well as below both Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. in size. Nvidia briefly claimed the title as the world’s largest stock last week. “In the near-term, it is plausible that investors begin suffering from AI-fatigue or become more broadly concerned about index concentration,” said Neville Javeri, portfolio manager and head of the Empiric LT Equity team at Allspring Global Investments. Even with the slump, Nvidia remains up more than 140% this year, making it the second-best performer among S&P 500 Index components, behind Super Micro Computer Inc., another favorite AI play. The stock suffered a drawdown of about 20% earlier this year, although it quickly returned to all-time highs. While investors have flocked to Nvidia given the sky-high demand for its chips used in AI processing, the scale of Nvidia’s rally — it also soared about 240% over the course of 2023 — has underlined concerns about its valuation. The stock trades at nearly 23 times estimated sales over the next 12 months, making it the most expensive in the S&P 500 by this measure. Still, it remains well liked on Wall Street. Nearly 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying, and the average analyst price target points to upside of about 10% from current levels. “The momentum in Nvidia and AI stocks in general has been staggering,” said Charlie Ashley, portfolio manager at Catalyst Funds. “In terms of investing, I would not be a contrarian right now.”\\n       ',\n",

       " 'Passenger vehicle sales is projected to grow at a moderate 3-5 per cent this financial year on account of a high-base effect of FY24, shrinking order book and subdued demand for entry-level variants, a report said on Monday. According to the report by credit ratings agency CareEdge, following robust growth of 90 per cent with volumes at 90,432 units in FY24, with an improving penetration rate, electric car sales in the passenger vehicle (PV) segment is likely to clock volume of around 1.30-1.50 lakh units in FY25. In FY22 and FY23, the PV industry experienced substantial year-on-year volume growth due to pent-up demand post-Covid recovery and new product introductions, it said. Utility vehicles played a significant role, with volumes increasing by 41 per cent in FY22 and 33.2 per cent in FY23. The industry benefitted from lower interest rates and an increased desire for personal mobility in the wake of the pandemic, CareEdge said. According to CareEdge, utility vehicles contributed 10-15 per cent of total passenger vehicle sales until FY12. It grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.51 per cent between FY13 and FY24, as consumer preference shifted towards utility vehicles that offered better and innovative designs, new models, technological, functional and safety features. For the past decade, the utility vehicles segment has consistently outperformed the passenger vehicle industry growth rate. In FY24, for the first time utility vehicles sales volume stood higher than passenger cars and vans, it said. Currently, utility vehicles account for over 55 per cent of all new PV sales and its share in overall passenger vehicle (PV) sales is expected to further rise over the medium-term, CareEdge said. \"The PV industry is expected to exhibit moderate volume growth of around 3-5 per cent in FY25 on account of a high-base effect of FY24, shrinking orderbook and expectation of persistently subdued demand for entry-level variants in FY25,\" said Arti Roy, Associate Director at CareEdge Ratings. Strong demand for new model launches and SUVs coupled with the expectation of interest rate cuts in the second half of FY25 is expected to keep the sales momentum rolling, she added. However, in line with CareEdge Ratings\\' expectation of volume growth of around 7-9 per cent in FY24, the PV industry volumes grew by 7.4 per cent in FY24, the ratings said. This moderation in year-on-year volume growth in FY24 was due to the levelling off of pent-up demand amid a hike in vehicle prices, high base effect of FY23 and the high-interest rate environment, it said. Strong order book in FY24, robust demand for new model launches and increasing demand in the sports utility vehicle (SUV) segment kept the sales momentum rolling, as per the report. \"While the market for premium vehicles is predicted to thrive, driven by a surge in demand for luxury and high-end models, entry-level variants are likely to see continued diminished demand due to a downturn in both rural and urban markets,\" said Hardik Shah, Director at CareEdge Ratings. The rural sector is feeling the pinch as entry-level vehicles are becoming more expensive, whereas urban consumers are increasingly opting for SUVs, reflecting a shift in market preferences, Shah added.\\n       ',\n",
       " 'Passenger vehicle sales is projected to grow at a moderate 3-5 per cent this financial year on account of a high-base effect of FY24, shrinking order book and subdued demand for entry-level variants, a report said on Monday. According to the report by credit ratings agency CareEdge, following robust growth of 90 per cent with volumes at 90,432 units in FY24, with an improving penetration rate, electric car sales in the passenger vehicle (PV) segment is likely to clock volume of around 1.30-1.50 lakh units in FY25. In FY22 and FY23, the PV industry experienced substantial year-on-year volume growth due to pent-up demand post-Covid recovery and new product introductions, it said. Utility vehicles played a significant role, with volumes increasing by 41 per cent in FY22 and 33.2 per cent in FY23. The industry benefitted from lower interest rates and an increased desire for personal mobility in the wake of the pandemic, CareEdge said. According to CareEdge, utility vehicles contributed 10-15 per cent of total passenger vehicle sales until FY12. It grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.51 per cent between FY13 and FY24, as consumer preference shifted towards utility vehicles that offered better and innovative designs, new models, technological, functional and safety features. For the past decade, the utility vehicles segment has consistently outperformed the passenger vehicle industry growth rate. In FY24, for the first time utility vehicles sales volume stood higher than passenger cars and vans, it said. Currently, utility vehicles account for over 55 per cent of all new PV sales and its share in overall passenger vehicle (PV) sales is expected to further rise over the medium-term, CareEdge said. \"The PV industry is expected to exhibit moderate volume growth of around 3-5 per cent in FY25 on account of a high-base effect of FY24, shrinking orderbook and expectation of persistently subdued demand for entry-level variants in FY25,\" said Arti Roy, Associate Director at CareEdge Ratings. Strong demand for new model launches and SUVs coupled with the expectation of interest rate cuts in the second half of FY25 is expected to keep the sales momentum rolling, she added. However, in line with CareEdge Ratings\\' expectation of volume growth of around 7-9 per cent in FY24, the PV industry volumes grew by 7.4 per cent in FY24, the ratings said. This moderation in year-on-year volume growth in FY24 was due to the levelling off of pent-up demand amid a hike in vehicle prices, high base effect of FY23 and the high-interest rate environment, it said. Strong order book in FY24, robust demand for new model launches and increasing demand in the sports utility vehicle (SUV) segment kept the sales momentum rolling, as per the report. \"While the market for premium vehicles is predicted to thrive, driven by a surge in demand for luxury and high-end models, entry-level variants are likely to see continued diminished demand due to a downturn in both rural and urban markets,\" said Hardik Shah, Director at CareEdge Ratings.

The closures were announced in January as part of the Indian company\\'s plan to turn around its loss-making UK business by switching to lower carbon electric arc furnaces, a proposal backed by 500 million pounds ($632 million) of government money. \"Tata’s workers are not just fighting for their jobs - they are fighting for the future of their communities and the future of steel in Wales,\" Unite General Secretary Sharon Graham said. Tata Steel employs more than 8,000 people in the UK. The company said in January about about 2,500 jobs of the total being cut were likely to go over the next 18 months. Reacting to the strike decision by the union, a Tata Steel spokesperson said: \"We are extremely disappointed by Unite’s unilateral decision to call strike action. Our existing steelmaking assets are near the end of their life, are operationally unstable and causing unsustainable losses of £1 million a day. This is why preparations to close the blast furnaces and associated plants in Port Talbot are unchanged.\" “However, if the safety and stability of our operations are put at risk by this action, we will be forced to accelerate those closure plans. After extensive negotiations with our unions we substantially improved our support offering for affected employees – the most generous package in our history. Rather than taking strike action, we would have expected Unite to put our improved offer to its members, as previously accepted by all unions, including Unite,\" the\\xa0spokesperson added.

According to the latest Kantar FMCG pulse report, this trend is expected to rise further with intensifying summer. It said the average household has expanded its consumption of bottled soft drinks by 250 ml in the last two years. Moreover, fabric softeners, still considered to be a premium laundry item, have now reached one in every four households in the country, the report said. Besides, washing liquids, another premium laundry product introduced by leading FMCG majors, breached the 100,000-tonne mark in FY24. All these trends are \"record breakers\", the report noted. The bottled soft drink category had a \"massive 41 per cent household growth in MAT (moving annual total) March 2023\" and continued to add more households and expanded 19 per cent in MAT March 2024. \"With the intensifying summer, the category is likely to continue its growth this year too,\" it said. On the consumption, the report said now consumers shop FMCG products 156 times a year, or every 56 hours from online or offline channels. However, it also added that the average basket value has gone down as shoppers are no longer buying more packs as they were purchasing earlier. \"The frequency and the pack trends indicate that shoppers are no longer reducing their pack sizes, but holding on to the ones they are buying. In other words, we are very likely at the juncture where we see shoppers buying slightly bigger packs from now on,\" it said. Now discretionary premium-end categories like washing liquids and indulgent products such as bottled soft drinks have performed exceedingly well. Still, groceries are the biggest household expense, accounting for over 24 per cent of all quarterly expenses in a household, it added. The report also highlighted that though inflation might have slowed to acceptable levels, its effects are not lost on the consumer. \"The worst of inflation is behind us, however, there are pockets of the market that are still under some stress...the shopper is looking at the future with great optimism, even those who are under stress, and this optimism has been the flag bearer of the Indian consumption story for long now,\" it said.\\n       ',\n",

The $2 billion, single-day inflow estimate by four bankers trails only the record-high $2.7 billion poured into Indian bonds on Aug. 20, 2014, as prospects of a credit rating upgrade gained traction. More than $200 billion in assets track the JPMorgan Emerging Market Index in which India will eventually have a weight of 10% by March 2025, suggesting total passive inflows of at least $20 billion over the 10-month period. The Reserve Bank of India, which has been keeping a hawk eye on the rupee to prevent it from plumbing lifetime lows, will be vigilant of the inflows and speculative positioning on the currency, but has not adopted additional surveillance measures, a source aware of the RBI\\'s plans said. \"It\\'s just a case of inflows, this time in debt instead of equities,\" the source said. \"It might be positive for the rupee and might be positive for FX reserves as well.\" The source and the bankers requested anonymity as they are not authorised to speak to the media. The RBI did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Since the rupee\\'s real effective exchange rate -- a gauge of its relative value against a basket of currencies -- is signaling it is moderately over-valued, the RBI is wary of any significant appreciation, the source said. So, while front-running in anticipation of the inflows may boost the rupee, a large rally is unlikely given the central bank\\'s grip on the currency, the bankers said. The RBI has said it will continue to boost its forex reserves opportunistically, which, in turn, helps avoid a sudden surge in the rupee. Since there is no precedent for these debt index-related inflows, bankers\\' estimates of the timing of flows are based on similar index adjustments in the equity markets. \"Obviously, all this is a first and you can\\'t be sure how things will be,\" the head of trading at a large foreign bank cautioned. \"However, based on how portfolio flows related to (equity) rebalancing happen, the money will come in on (June) 27 or 28.\" In anticipation, large foreign banks could look at building short dollar/rupee positions to help manage inflows when they happen, an FX trader at a foreign bank said.

       " 'The Indian automobile industry grew 19 per cent to Rs 10.22 lakh crore in FY24 driven by a robust growth in the utility and sports utility vehicle (SUV) segment, a report said on Wednesday. The volume grew by 10 per cent during the year, the report by management consulting firm Primus Partners said. A notable shift in the UV and SUV segment was that the volume increased by 23 per cent and price by 16 per cent leading to overall value increase by 39 per cent last fiscal year. The average price increase in this segment was due to general rise in prices, shift to higher segment, shift to hybrid and automatic, popularity of sunroof and shift to electric vehicles (EVs), it said. Indians are preferring higher, more expensive models across segments, and the average price of vehicles is increasing, as per the report. \"India is at the forefront in leading the global automobile race, bypassing lower-priced products and creating more value in feature-rich, higher-priced vehicles. Consumer preferences and robust economic fundamentals are drivers of this transformation in the Indian automobile industry. Significantly, the UV and SUV segments are becoming a preferred choice for most Indian consumers,\" said Anurag Singh, Managing Director of Primus Partners. On the other hand, the passenger vehicle (PV) segment saw a decline of 9 per cent in volume due to a slight price increase, resulting in 4 per cent value drop. In the two-wheeler segment, India witnessed 10 per cent increase in volume and 13 per cent in value. The three-wheeler segment grew by 16 per cent in volume and 24 per cent in value and the commercial vehicle segment rose by 3 per cent in volume and 7 per cent in value. The report noted that while India is at number three in terms of vehicles registered behind China and the US, in value terms it is behind countries like Japan and Germany. Besides, the average price of a vehicle in India is lower than that of many advanced countries. The value of the Indian Automobile industry is growing at a faster rate than volume. Also, according to the report, India is the number one producer of two-wheelers with more than 20 million units produced last year. The two-wheeler segment dominates in volume with 76 per cent share, while value share is 18 per cent. As per the report, 2023-24 proved to be a strong year for the global automobile industry. The lingering pent-up demand from the pandemic period remained active while many of the supply chain constraints had eased up.\\n       ',\n",

On the other hand, the passenger vehicle (PV) segment saw a decline of 9 per cent in volume due to a slight price increase, resulting in 4 per cent value drop. In the two-wheeler segment, India witnessed 10 per cent increase in volume and 13 per cent in value. The three-wheeler segment grew by 16 per cent in volume and 24 per cent in value and the commercial vehicle segment rose by 3 per cent in volume and 7 per cent in value. The report noted that while India is at number three in terms of vehicles registered behind China and the US, in value terms it is behind countries like Japan and Germany. Besides, the average price of a vehicle in India is lower than that of many advanced countries. The value of the Indian Automobile industry is growing at a faster rate than volume. Also, according to the report, India is the number one producer of two-wheelers with more than 20 million units produced last year. The two-wheeler segment dominates in volume with 76 per cent share, while value share is 18 per cent. As per the report, 2023-24 proved to be a strong year for the global automobile industry. The lingering pent-up demand from the pandemic period remained active while many of the supply chain constraints had eased up.\\n       ',\n",

Besides building solar parks to produce electricity from sunlight and wind farms that do the same from wind, the conglomerate is building major facilities to manufacture electrolyzers for making green hydrogen, wind power turbines and solar panels. Green hydrogen, which is made by splitting hydrogen from water with the help of electrolyzers powered by clean energy, is seen as a potential panacea for decarbonizing the industry as well as transportation. Speaking at \\'Infrastructure - the Catalyst for India\\'s Future\\' event of Crisil, Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani said energy transition and digital infrastructure are trillion-dollar opportunities which will transform India both at a local and at a global scale. \"The next decade will see us invest more than USD 100 billion in the energy transition space and further expand our integrated renewable energy value chain that today already spans the manufacturing of every major component required for green energy generation,\" he said. The coal-to-ports group wants to produce the \"world\\'s least expensive green electron\" that will become the feedstock for several sectors that must meet the sustainability mandate. \"And to make this happen, we are already building the world\\'s largest single-site renewable energy park in Khavda, in the district of Kutch (in Gujarat). Just this single location will generate 30 GW of power, thereby taking our total renewable energy capacity to 50 GW by 2030,\" he said. Adani said the energy transition space will fundamentally change the global energy landscape forever. \"The global transition market was valued at approximately USD 3 trillion in 2023 and is expected to grow to nearly USD 6 trillion by 2030, and thereafter double every 10 years till 2050.\" \"As many of you know, in the case of India, our country aims to install 500 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2030. This ambitious target will require annual investments of over USD 150 billion dollars. The transition to green energy in India is expected to generate millions of new jobs in sectors such as solar and wind, energy storage, hydrogen and its derivatives, EV charging stations, as well as grid infrastructure development,\" he said. On digital infrastructure, he said data is indeed the new oil and at the heart of all the action is the Data Centre - the critical infrastructure needed to power all forms of computational needs, especially AI workloads for machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, computer vision, and deep learning. All of this is dependent on the ability to process data at an unprecedented speed and scale which are the precise capabilities that data centres provide. However, this will need massive amounts of energy, making the data centre business the largest energy consuming industry in the world, he said. \"This makes the energy transition even more complex and is raising electricity prices, thereby adding to the already high prices because of the combined impact of climate change and demand growth,\" Adani said. The billionaire said the infrastructure required for energy transition and the infrastructure required for digital transformation are now inseparable as the technology sector becomes the largest consumer of the precious green electrons. Adani group\\'s digital footprint will span industrial clouds across each of its businesses that it will productize and then take to market, operational technology cybersecurity offerings, super apps to leverage its B2C businesses across wide variety of consumer facing businesses, Artificial Intelligence labs to capitalize on India\\'s fast emerging expertise to provide AI services to the world, and Data Centres that will form the backbone of the energy intensive digital revolution. \"In fact, it is anticipated that by the year 2030, the world will need 100 to 150 GW of additional green energy just for the AI data centres.

       " 'India has become the largest market for Nestle globally for its instant noodles and soup brand Maggi and the second largest for chocolate wafer brand KitKat, according to the latest annual report of its local subsidiary. Besides, the India market with a high double-digit growth has become one of the fastest growing markets for Nestle, it added. \"Penetration, premiumisation and innovation, combined with disciplined resource allocation, have been key in driving business, making your company one of the fastest growing markets for Nestle globally,\" said Nestle India\\'s annual report for 2023-24. Nestle, which sells its popular instant noodles under brand Maggi and prepared dishes and cooking aids here, sold over six billion servings of Maggi during FY24, \"making India the largest NestlÃ© market for Maggi worldwide,\" it said. Nestle is expanding its play under brand Maggi and has launched Oats Noodle, Korean Noodles and various masala variants at an affordable Rs 10. \"The Prepared Dishes and Cooking Aids business recorded a strong growth momentum. This was aided by a balance of product mix, pricing and volume growth in Maggi noodles and Maggi Masala-ae-Magic, supported by strong consumer engagement and market presence with media campaigns and attractive consumer activations,\" it said. In confectionary, Nestle India said it sold 4,200 million fingers of KitKat. The growth was fuelled by the launch of new products, expansion of the distribution network and innovative brand activations. \"KitKat has emerged as the star performer, by not only delivering strong growth but making NestlÃ© India the second largest market for the brand globally,\" it said. In India, brand Maggi recovered after a five-month ban on its instant noodles over allegation of containing lead beyond permissible limits. However, the instant noodles returned to market after a relaunch in November 2015 and later Nestle India extended the brand in the food segment and adjacencies. Before the crisis, the brand had over 70 per cent market share in the instant noodles segment, which it still has not reached as the competition has intensified in the segment with arrival of new players. Nestle, which is setting up its tenth Indian factory in Odisha, reaffirmed the significance of India as a market. \"Strengthening this further, your company is poised to invest approximately Rs 7,500 crore between 2020 and 2025 to develop new capabilities and expand existing ones with a sharp focus on sustained growth and innovation,\" its Chairman & Managing Director Suresh Narayanan said while addressing shareholders in the report. The company is focussing on innovations and in the past eight years, it has launched over 140 products. A significant portion of sales in 2023 was attributed to innovative products. According to Narayanan, plant-based products present a significant opportunity for Nestle India, which has been operating here for 112 years. It is also expanding its presence and through RUrban journey its direct coverage has gone beyond two lakh villages. Nestle India recently announced to continue to pay royalty to its parent company at the existing rate of 4.5 per cent of net sales after a proposal to hike it was rejected by shareholders. The company\\'s board approved the continuation of payment of general licence fees (royalty) at the rate of 4.5 per cent to Societe des Produits Nestle SA (licensor) and recommended to the members of the company for their approval. In April, Nestle India\\'s board had approved increasing royalty to its parent company by 0.15 per cent per year for the next five years, thereby enhancing it to 5.25 per cent of net sales. In its annual report, Nestle India said \"the general licence fees (royalty) rate paid by the company to the licensor is comparatively lower\" in comparison to other multinational corporations (MNCs) in India.

       " 'Hyundai Motor India Ltd plans to launch four electric vehicle models in future, including Creta EV, in the last quarter of the current fiscal, according to the company\\'s preliminary IPO papers filed with Sebi. The company is looking to maximise the price competitiveness of its electric vehicle (EV) models and intends to focus on securing local production capabilities for key parts, such as cells, battery packs, power electronics, and drivetrain and building a localised EV supply chain. In the draft red herring prospectus (DRHP), Hyundai Motor India Ltd (HMIL) said it seeks to calibrate its EV strategy and plan EV timelines in line with market demands in India by launching the appropriate EV models within each price segment. \"We are following a transition strategy, having started with the launch of high-end premium EVs and plan to transition towards the mass markets as the EV market and ecosystem scales up in India. In line with the same, we aim to launch four EV models in future, including Creta EV in the last quarter of fiscal 2025,\" the company said. At present, HMIL sells two EV models in India -- IONIQ5 and Kona Electric -- priced around Rs 45 lakh and Rs 24 lakh, respectively. The company further said, \"To maximise price competitiveness of our EV models, we intend to focus on securing local production capabilities for key parts, such as cells, battery packs, power electronics, drivetrain and building a localised EV supply chain\". HMIL has leased a section of the Chennai Manufacturing Plant to Mobis, a Hyundai Motor Company (HMC) group firm, for the assembly of EV batteries, which will be supplied to the company, in turn, reducing import costs for battery packs, it added. \"Further, we intend to localise the EV supply chain through collaboration with both local and global EV power electronic vendors,\" it said, adding recently in 2024, HMC announced a strategic collaboration with Exide Energy Solutions Ltd to facilitate localised battery production and supply in India. Similarly, HMIL said, \"Currently, our company is also exploring different avenues for a strategic collaboration for the production of batteries. We believe the addition of domestically sourced EV models will contribute to diversifying our passenger vehicle offering and further expand our market coverage\". Further, in the near term, the company aims to increase localisation to secure production-linked incentive (PLI) subsidies and transition to a dedicated EV platform to optimise costs, it added. Beyond EV manufacturing, HMIL said, \"We aim to develop the EV infrastructure in India by constructing charging stations. As of March 31, 2024, we have established 11 fast charging stations in India. We intend to support the adoption of EVs by installing charging points across cities and highways in India\". Pointing out threats and challenges to the automotive industry in its DRHP, the company pointed out \\'ad-hoc changes in policies\\' as one of the factors. \"Another challenge that the industry is facing is frequent changes in policies, which makes it difficult for the auto industry stakeholders not only to ensure adherence but also commit investments. Overall policy stability and transparency will be required going forward to ensure smooth technology transition and localisation in the country,\" HMIL said. Further, it also pointed out that there are still concerns about meeting the eligibility criteria and availing of the benefits under the localisation norms. The government is encouraging localisation across sectors, especially in the automotive sector via policies like PLI for automotive technology and advanced cell chemistry, phased manufacturing program, \\'Atmanirbhar Bharat\\' and Make in India, it said. \"While the end goal of localisation is to reduce import dependence, and bring down overall manufacturing costs, it also involves significant initial capital investments from several stakeholders within the automotive industry,\" HMIL said in its preliminary papers. The company further said, \"While the government has designed the schemes to support investments by offering several subsidies and import duty benefits, there are still concerns around meeting the eligibility criteria and availing of the benefits\". Going forward, it said, \"Simplification and better tracking of the policies will ensure localisation in India. The progress of the vendors tied up with individual OEMs would also lead to a change in the risk profile of the industry from a supply-side perspective\". Last week, HMIL filed preliminary papers with Sebi to launch an initial public offering (IPO). The company\\'s IPO, if it goes through, would be the largest in India, surpassing LIC\\'s share sale of Rs 21,000 crore.

       " 'Hyundai Motor India Ltd plans to launch four electric vehicle models in future, including Creta EV, in the last quarter of the current fiscal, according to the company\\'s preliminary IPO papers filed with Sebi. The company is looking to maximise the price competitiveness of its electric vehicle (EV) models and intends to focus on securing local production capabilities for key parts, such as cells, battery packs, power electronics, and drivetrain and building a localised EV supply chain. In the draft red herring prospectus (DRHP), Hyundai Motor India Ltd (HMIL) said it seeks to calibrate its EV strategy and plan EV timelines in line with market demands in India by launching the appropriate EV models within each price segment. \"We are following a transition strategy, having started with the launch of high-end premium EVs and plan to transition towards the mass markets as the EV market and ecosystem scales up in India. In line with the same, we aim to launch four EV models in future, including Creta EV in the last quarter of fiscal 2025,\" the company said. At present, HMIL sells two EV models in India -- IONIQ5 and Kona Electric -- priced around Rs 45 lakh and Rs 24 lakh, respectively. The company further said, \"To maximise price competitiveness of our EV models, we intend to focus on securing local production capabilities for key parts, such as cells, battery packs, power electronics, drivetrain and building a localised EV supply chain\". HMIL has leased a section of the Chennai Manufacturing Plant to Mobis, a Hyundai Motor Company (HMC) group firm, for the assembly of EV batteries, which will be supplied to the company, in turn, reducing import costs for battery packs, it added. \"Further, we intend to localise the EV supply chain through collaboration with both local and global EV power electronic vendors,\" it said, adding recently in 2024, HMC announced a strategic collaboration with Exide Energy Solutions Ltd to facilitate localised battery production and supply in India. Similarly, HMIL said, \"Currently, our company is also exploring different avenues for a strategic collaboration for the production of batteries. We believe the addition of domestically sourced EV models will contribute to diversifying our passenger vehicle offering and further expand our market coverage\". Further, in the near term, the company aims to increase localisation to secure production-linked incentive (PLI) subsidies and transition to a dedicated EV platform to optimise costs, it added. Beyond EV manufacturing, HMIL said, \"We aim to develop the EV infrastructure in India by constructing charging stations. As of March 31, 2024, we have established 11 fast charging stations in India. We intend to support the adoption of EVs by installing charging points across cities and highways in India\". Pointing out threats and challenges to the automotive industry in its DRHP, the company pointed out \\'ad-hoc changes in policies\\' as one of the factors. \"Another challenge that the industry is facing is frequent changes in policies, which makes it difficult for the auto industry stakeholders not only to ensure adherence but also commit investments. Overall policy stability and transparency will be required going forward to ensure smooth technology transition and localisation in the country,\" HMIL said. Further, it also pointed out that there are still concerns about meeting the eligibility criteria and availing of the benefits under the localisation norms. The government is encouraging localisation across sectors, especially in the automotive sector via policies like PLI for automotive technology and advanced cell chemistry, phased manufacturing program, \\'Atmanirbhar Bharat\\' and Make in India, it said. \"While the end goal of localisation is to reduce import dependence, and bring down overall manufacturing costs, it also involves significant initial capital investments from several stakeholders within the automotive industry,\" HMIL said in its preliminary papers.

       " 'Fitch Ratings on Tuesday raised India\\'s growth forecast for current fiscal to 7.2 per cent, from 7 per cent projected in March, citing a recovery in consumer spending and increased investment. For the fiscal years 2025-26 and 2026-27, Fitch projected growth rates of 6.5 per cent and 6.2 per cent, respectively. \"We expect the Indian economy to expand by a strong 7.2 per cent in FY24/25 (an upward revision of 0.2 pp from the March GEO),\" Fitch said in its global economic outlook report. Fitch\\'s estimates are in line with that of RBI which earlier this month projected Indian economy to expand 7.2 per cent in the current fiscal on the back of improving rural demand and moderating inflation. Investment will continue to rise but more slowly than in recent quarters, while consumer spending will recover with elevated consumer confidence, it said. Fitch said purchasing managers survey data point to continued growth at the start of the current financial year. It said signs of the coming monsoon season being more normal should support growth and make inflation less volatile, though a recent heatwave poses a risk. \"We expect growth in later years to slow and approach our medium-term trend estimate,\" it said, adding growth will be driven by consumer spending and investment. The Indian economy grew 8.2 per cent in the last fiscal (2023-24), with a 7.8 per cent expansion in March quarter. Inflation, Fitch expects, will decline to 4.5 per cent by end 2024 and average 4.3 per cent in 2025 and 2026. Fitch said it expects the RBI to cut policy interest rates by 25 basis points this year to 6.25 per cent.\\n       ',\n",

       " 'Given the current economic growth rate, SBI is expecting 14-15 per cent loan growth during the fiscal year 2024-25, the bank\\'s chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara said. \"Normally the way we look at it is that the GDP growth rate plus inflation and 2-3 per cent over that. That gives us the number around 14 per cent or so,\" Khara told PTI in an interview. \"Hence, 14-15 per cent credit growth depends upon the opportunities available for lending, and it meets our risk appetite. We will be happy to grow at this pace,\" he said. As far as deposits are concerned, he said, it grew by 11 per cent last year. \"And we have some elbow room available in terms of excess SLR and which ensures that we don\\'t have any pressure on us to raise the deposit rates for supporting our loan-to-deposit ratio,\" he said. The bank has an excess Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) between Rs 3.5 lakh crore and Rs 4 lakh crore. \"Incidentally, I may add here that our loan-to-deposit ratio is around 68-69 per cent only. That leaves enough room for us to lend without having pressure on the deposit interest rates. Nevertheless, he said, \"We always give importance to deposits. That is the reason why we increased the interest rate for the short-term deposits recently because we felt that there\\'s room for improvement...we should improve our deposit growth rate to some extent during this year. And our effort would be that we should at least grow around 12-13 per cent this year.\" Last month, SBI hiked the fixed deposit rate on select short-term maturity up to 75 basis points. For retail term deposits of 46-179 days, the rate increased by 75 basis points to 5.50 per cent against the earlier 4.75 per cent. Asked about the Net Interest Margin (NIM) outlook for the current financial year, Khara expressed hope and said it would be around the same level recorded in FY24 or could be 2-3 basis points movement here or there. The domestic NIM of the bank stood at 3.43 per cent for FY24 down by 15 basis points (bps) while the whole bank NIM stood at 3.28 per cent lower by 9 bps year-on-year basis. The rise in both rupee liquidity and dollar liquidity cost due to tight monetary policy pursued by central banks across the globe was a major factor affecting NIM during FY24. As far as Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) are concerned, Khara said, \"We should have a downward trajectory both for net and gross. However, it is very difficult to make any projections as it is also a function of the macroeconomy.\" The bank is trying to insulate its book for macro stress nevertheless it\\'s difficult to give any kind of guidance on NPAs. \"Our guidance as far as our credit cost is concerned, we have kept it at 0.50 per cent but our effort is to keep it at the level of 0.29 per cent,\" he added. Gross NPA of SBI declined to 2.24 per cent, an improvement of 54 bps compared to previous FY23 while the net NPA stood at 0.57 per cent, an improvement of 10 bps YoY. The credit cost also fell by 3 bps to 0.29 per cent at the end of FY24.\\n       ',\n",

       " 'Indian family-run business houses have in recent years seen ugly public spats between owners over control. But metals-to-ports conglomerate Essar’s Ruia family seems to be an exception. Three generations of the Ruia family – founder brother Shashi and Ravi Ruia, their children and grandchildren – continue to live under one roof and jointly run the business empire. They share the family homes in Mumbai, Delhi and London as well as business that now spans energy, metals and mining, infrastructure and logistics and technology and retail. Prashant Ruia, son of Shahi Ruia and director of Essar Capital, which manages the group’s portfolio of investments, considers himself fortunate to be surrounded by support system of his family, where members cherish the strong bonds transcending generations. In an interview to PTI, Ruia said he is of firm belief that maintaining strong family relations require careful alignment of goals and ensuring each family member has space to express themselves and thrive. ”If the goals are aligned and people are given space to express themselves, it is possible (for families to stick together). I am surprised that the tradition is coming down so fast. We have maintained it, and it has been a tremendous experience…having that support system at home, while travelling, at work, of course… is quite good and we are very happy,” he said. First generation entrepreneurs Shashi and Ravi Ruia founded Essar group in 1969 when it bagged a Rs 2.5 crore order from the Madras Port Trust for the construction of an outer breakwater in the port. In the early years, Essar focused on the construction and engineering sector. It built a number of major infrastructure projects, including bridges, dams, and power plants. In the 1980s, Essar diversified into the energy sector, with the acquisition of a number of oil and gas assets. In the 1990s, Essar expanded its operations into the steel and telecommunications sectors. It built steel plants, an oil refinery and India’s second largest telecom operator with Hutchison. It exited the telecom business, sold oil refinery to a consortium led by Russia’s Rosneft and had to let go the steel plants to ArcelorMittal when insolvency proceedings were initiated to recover unpaid loans. After repaying loans of close to Rs 2 lakh crore, Essar is now reinventing itself. ”Revenues of the group are about USD 15 billion. In terms of Group EBITDA, we have a run rate of about a billion dollars, that is about Rs 8,000 crore and the group is currently valued…the assets under management…is valued at about USD 8 billion. So that’s sort of where we are as a group today,” Ruia said. The group has about 14 portfolio companies where investments are being channelised. ”Some of these companies are in India, some international. We operate globally. And we are building out,” he said. The conglomerate now holds assets that span a 10 million tonne a year oil refinery in the UK, 15 trillion cubic feet reserves of hydrocarbons in India and Vietnam and a 1,200 MW power plant in India. Its infra sector assets include a storage terminal in the UK of 3 million cubic meters capacity and a 20 MTPA port in India, metal and mining sector assets include a major iron ore mine and pellet project in India and the US, technology & services sector assets include global EPC business and IT solutions provider with centres across 35+ countries. The group has also made foray into renewables recently. In a country where young children born into wealthy business families are forgiven for living it up as a teenager, Ruia showed up at Essar office fairly early. ”As far as my journey is concerned, yes, I did start early. But at that time, our group was fairly small in the sense papa (my father) and chacha (uncle)… they got started in 1969. But we were still a very small group in 80-85 and I started working with my father in all my holidays at the age of 12….well, not working but actually being there,” Ruia said. He recalls how ”he was inclined towards work” from the beginning, and even as he started college, clocking office hours daily became part of his regular schedule. Ruia said he even passed an opportunity to study abroad, opting instead to continue working within the Group and contribute to growing business. His stint started with participating in meetings, listening and understanding, moving from one department to another to observe the dynamics of business, and by 17, Ruia was given responsibility at the Group. ”…we were in early stage…things were just getting going and it was very exciting time for us. And I was enjoying myself. So `Marwari School of Management’ was the one I went to,” he said in lighter vein. Prashant has a sibling Anshuman and cousins Rewant and Smiti (children of Ravi Ruia). The family has stayed together for over 50 years, Ruia said with pride. ”We have always stayed together… my father and uncle actually, this is a tradition…it was set up by my father, my uncle and my grandmother. So she made sure that we all stay together and it’s been like that ever since,” Ruia said. Some of the most famous family feuds in India include the public battle between Mukesh and Anil Ambani to control the Reliance empire after their father Dhirubhai Ambani died without a will.

       " 'Indian family-run business houses have in recent years seen ugly public spats between owners over control. But metals-to-ports conglomerate Essar’s Ruia family seems to be an exception. Three generations of the Ruia family – founder brother Shashi and Ravi Ruia, their children and grandchildren – continue to live under one roof and jointly run the business empire. They share the family homes in Mumbai, Delhi and London as well as business that now spans energy, metals and mining, infrastructure and logistics and technology and retail. Prashant Ruia, son of Shahi Ruia and director of Essar Capital, which manages the group’s portfolio of investments, considers himself fortunate to be surrounded by support system of his family, where members cherish the strong bonds transcending generations. In an interview to PTI, Ruia said he is of firm belief that maintaining strong family relations require careful alignment of goals and ensuring each family member has space to express themselves and thrive. ”If the goals are aligned and people are given space to express themselves, it is possible (for families to stick together). I am surprised that the tradition is coming down so fast. We have maintained it, and it has been a tremendous experience…having that support system at home, while travelling, at work, of course… is quite good and we are very happy,” he said. First generation entrepreneurs Shashi and Ravi Ruia founded Essar group in 1969 when it bagged a Rs 2.5 crore order from the Madras Port Trust for the construction of an outer breakwater in the port. In the early years, Essar focused on the construction and engineering sector. It built a number of major infrastructure projects, including bridges, dams, and power plants. In the 1980s, Essar diversified into the energy sector, with the acquisition of a number of oil and gas assets. In the 1990s, Essar expanded its operations into the steel and telecommunications sectors. It built steel plants, an oil refinery and India’s second largest telecom operator with Hutchison. It exited the telecom business, sold oil refinery to a consortium led by Russia’s Rosneft and had to let go the steel plants to ArcelorMittal when insolvency proceedings were initiated to recover unpaid loans. After repaying loans of close to Rs 2 lakh crore, Essar is now reinventing itself. ”Revenues of the group are about USD 15 billion. In terms of Group EBITDA, we have a run rate of about a billion dollars, that is about Rs 8,000 crore and the group is currently valued…the assets under management…is valued at about USD 8 billion. So that’s sort of where we are as a group today,” Ruia said. The group has about 14 portfolio companies where investments are being channelised. ”Some of these companies are in India, some international. We operate globally. And we are building out,” he said. The conglomerate now holds assets that span a 10 million tonne a year oil refinery in the UK, 15 trillion cubic feet reserves of hydrocarbons in India and Vietnam and a 1,200 MW power plant in India. Its infra sector assets include a storage terminal in the UK of 3 million cubic meters capacity and a 20 MTPA port in India, metal and mining sector assets include a major iron ore mine and pellet project in India and the US, technology & services sector assets include global EPC business and IT solutions provider with centres across 35+ countries. The group has also made foray into renewables recently. In a country where young children born into wealthy business families are forgiven for living it up as a teenager, Ruia showed up at Essar office fairly early. ”As far as my journey is concerned, yes, I did start early. But at that time, our group was fairly small in the sense papa (my father) and chacha (uncle)… they got started in 1969. But we were still a very small group in 80-85 and I started working with my father in all my holidays at the age of 12….well, not working but actually being there,” Ruia said. He recalls how ”he was inclined towards work” from the beginning, and even as he started college, clocking office hours daily became part of his regular schedule. Ruia said he even passed an opportunity to study abroad, opting instead to continue working within the Group and contribute to growing business. His stint started with participating in meetings, listening and understanding, moving from one department to another to observe the dynamics of business, and by 17, Ruia was given responsibility at the Group. ”…we were in early stage…things were just getting going and it was very exciting time for us. And I was enjoying myself. So `Marwari School of Management’ was the one I went to,” he said in lighter vein. Prashant has a sibling Anshuman and cousins Rewant and Smiti (children of Ravi Ruia). The family has stayed together for over 50 years, Ruia said with pride. ”We have always stayed together… my father and uncle actually, this is a tradition…it was set up by my father, my uncle and my grandmother. So she made sure that we all stay together and it’s been like that ever since,” Ruia said. Some of the most famous family feuds in India include the public battle between Mukesh and Anil Ambani to control the Reliance empire after their father Dhirubhai Ambani died without a will. A couple of years back, Hinduja brothers battled over control of the USD 18 billion 107-year-old British-Indian group that has six publicly traded entities including Ashok Leyland. In 2000, Rajan and Anil Nanda sparred over Escorts empire built by their father Har Prasad.

The competition in the Indian RAC market has ”intensified” with the presence of homegrown and leading foreign players, said Voltas, a market leader in the segment.Moreover, the competitive ”intensity is going to increase” further in the near future, the company said while discussing challenges and opportunities.Factors like increasingly hot summers, rising disposable incomes, and the quest for a better lifestyle with easy access to consumer finance are likely to drive growth for this room air-conditioner segment. ”The Indian RAC market is expected to grow at a healthy CAGR of 12 per cent to reach a figure of Rs 50,000 crores by 2028-29,” said Voltas.Voltas sold over 2 million AC units in 2023-24, which, according to the company, was the highest number of ACs ever sold by any brand in a single year.”Voltas also sold 1 million AC units in an incredibly short time frame of just 110 days from January 1, 2024, till April 20, 2024,” it said. This season several companies have reported over two-fold growth in April and May as sales skyrocketed in the blistering summer, when the mercury was touching around 45 degrees, creating a new record at several places.” Moving ahead, Voltas aims to reinforce its market leadership through the expansion of Exclusive Brand Outlets (EBOs) and other channels,” it said. Besides RAC, competitive intensity is also going to increase in Commercial Air Conditioning (CAC) where leading foreign players have started focusing on this sector.”The demand for commercial air conditioning is increasing across industries and commercial establishments, and driven by a focus on comfort and sustainability,” the report said.Earlier, the Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association had said that this year, it expects record sales of RAC, taking the annual sale of around 14 million units in 2024. However, Voltas, in its report, also said the recent implementation of QCO (Quality Control Orders) norms affects the imports of components, which pose challenges for the industry.Still, the Indian air condition industry is highly dependent on imports for components, which is around an average of 65 to 70 per cent of the product value.Over commercial refrigeration (CR) products, Voltas’ annual report stated it will continue to grow over 10 per cent per annum till FY 2028-29.In this segment, ”many of the product categories are likely to register high double-digit growth”, it claimed.”Under the ’Make in India’ initiative, many brands have set up new facilities and expanded local manufacturing.

       " 'Essar Group sees huge growth potential in its IT firm Black Box with boom in artificial intelligence (AI) technology driving demand for new data centres and managed services across the globe, a top official of the multinational conglomerate said. In an exclusive interview with PTI, Prashant Ruia, director of Essar Capital, which manages the group’s portfolio of investment, expressed confidence in the sector. ”This is a company which can see tremendous growth, because the kind of growth taking place in data centres and managed services globally is exponential,” he said. Black Box, listed on the Indian stock exchanges, has operations spread across 35 countries, but its major business comes from the US. ”It’s obviously listed in India, but it’s primarily headquartered, main operations are in the US. We currently do about USD 800 million of revenue in Black Box… about 75 per cent of the market for us is the US. We have a very large operation headquartered in Dallas, we have close to 3,000 people,” he said. More than USD 200 billion/year of data centres are getting built in America alone, he said. He attributed this to the growth of Artificial Intelligence, which has ”dramatically” increased the requirements for computing power. ”People are building massive data centres in the US to manage this requirement. And that’s a huge market opportunity. I think even in India, a very large number of data centres are coming up,” he said. Ruia, however, noted that the company is not into investing in data centres, but helping build and manage them. Black Box reported a multi-fold ascent to Rs 138 crore in its profits for FY24, while its revenue remained flat at Rs 6,282 crore. Founded by brothers Shashi Ruia and Ravi Ruia in 1969, the Essar group, which once owned Hutchison Essar (now Vodafone-Idea), has no plans to re-enter the telecom market due to a lack of growth potential, said Ruia. The group ventured into the telecom space in 1995, with Essar Cellphone, and started GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) operations from Delhi in the same year. Through the Hutchison Essar partnership, it started acquiring telecom circles in India, and by 2006, all the circles were under Hutchison Essar Limited. ”From 1995-2010, it was an amazing time for being in the telecom sector. And we certainly benefited from that investment, we’ve benefited from that growth. Those days, there were 10-12 telecom companies, it was not a two-player or three-player market,” he noted, calling it a golden phase for investment in the sector. In 2006, Hong Kong-based Hutchison sold 67 per cent of its stake to Vodafone for about USD 13.1 billion and exited India. Essar, which continued to hold a 33 per cent stake in Vodafone-Essar, too sold its stake and bid goodbye to the telecom business. ”When we started, nobody had a mobile phone. And then we build the business. By the time we sold it to Vodafone, we had 90 million customers,” Ruia reminisced. Ruia said he believes the market was once ripe for growth, offering unique opportunities to scale and invest. However, he does not see the same potential today, citing the lack of opportunities to expand and invest. ”We were addressing a market, which was open — the customers did not have phones, we were introducing phones… but today, everybody already has a phone, everybody has a service. ”So unless there’s a unique proposition, it’s very difficult, for anybody for that matter, to enter the telecom space at this stage,” he said.\\n       ',\n",

       " 'Tesla shareholders have voted to reinstate Elon Musk\\'s substantial $44.9 billion compensation package, reversing an earlier rejection by a Delaware judge this year. During Tesla\\'s annual meeting in Austin, Texas, on June 13, Musk assured shareholders of his continued commitment to the company. He emphasised that under the terms of the compensation package, he is restricted from selling any stock for the next five years. \"It’s not actually cash, and I can’t cut and run, nor would I want to,\" Musk stated, reported Associated Press. Although specific vote counts on Musk’s pay were not immediately disclosed, Tesla confirmed that shareholders had overwhelmingly supported Musk’s compensation plan, originally endorsed by the board and shareholders six years ago. Tesla valued the reinstated package at $44.9 billion in its April regulatory filing, marking a decrease from its previous high of $56 billion, reflecting fluctuations in Tesla\\'s stock, which has seen a 25% decline this year. The Number Game In 2018, Elon Musk\\'s compensation plan was designed with 10 years of performance goals. If Musk meets these targets, he receives a payout in the form of shares. In total, he could earn 303 million shares, adjusted for stock splits, representing about 12% of Tesla\\'s total shareholding from the year 2018. Musk currently owns about 13% of the company. These shares would be distributed in 12 parts, each linked to Musk achieving specific goals approved by Tesla\\'s board. For each set of goals completed, Musk would receive 1% of Tesla\\'s outstanding shares at that time. For example, if Tesla had 1,000,000 shares outstanding when a goal was met, Musk would receive 10,000 shares as part of that portion of his compensation package. The targets encompassed 28 specific milestones, including 12 linked to market capitalisation, with the ambitious goal of increasing Tesla\\'s market capitalisation to $650 billion from around $59 billion in 2018, a feat initially deemed highly improbable by experts. Additionally, eight milestones were tied to earnings and another eight to revenue. Despite skepticism, Musk successfully surpassed these challenges, including achieving the $650 billion market capitalisation milestone when Tesla\\'s peak value doubled in November 2021. Though it has since decreased to $572 billion, Musk met all 12 targets in 2023, alongside achieving all eight earnings milestones. Only a few revenue milestones remain unmet, with just one revenue goal outstanding. According to the 2023 proxy statement, Musk has earned nearly all of the 303 million options available to him, leaving only 25 million unclaimed, reports Barron’s. At current prices, the entire package is valued at $56 billion. Each option carries a strike price of about $23 per share, adjusted for stock splits, while Tesla\\'s stock is valued at roughly $650 billion, equating to slightly over $200 per share. Achieving the $650 billion market cap means each of Musk\\'s share is valued at approximately $180, calculated as the difference between the current stock price and the strike price. Multiplying $180 by 303 million options results in a total value close to $56 billion. This compensation plan essentially represented Musk\\'s confidence in his ability to elevate Tesla\\'s market valuation from $60 billion to at least $650 billion, marking a 983% increase, all while driving the company towards sustained profitability over a decade.

       " 'The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has issued a notice to SpiceJet over an insolvency plea filed by Engine Lease Finance BV, an aircraft engine lessor of the debt-ridden air carrier. The single-member NCLT bench has asked SpiceJet to file a response over the Engine Lease Finance (ELF) plea and directed listing the matter for hearing on August 2, 2024. During the proceedings, SpiceJet raised objections over the maintainability of the plea, in which ELF has claimed a payment default of over USD 12 million (around Rs 100 crore). ELF has leased eight engines to SpiceJet. Along with interest and rental, ELF has claimed around USD 16 million dues. Earlier, the matter was listed before a Delhi-based bench of the NCLT on May 29. SpiceJet had then raised objections against ELF’s plea citing technical defects and the tribunal gave the engine lessor an opportunity to rectify the errors. On Wednesday, when the defects were rectified, the insolvency tribunal issued a notice to the airline. Headquartered in Shannon, Ireland, ELF is the world’s leading independent engine financing and leasing company. It entered into an agreement with SpiceJet in 2017 to lease engines. According to the petitioner, the low-budget carrier has defaulted on payments since April 2021. SpiceJet has contended that there is a pre-existing dispute between them. In 2023, ELF had approached the Delhi High Court against SpiceJet after terminating the lease for two engines and sought possession. Later, both the parties arrived at a settlement and ELF decided not to pursue the matter. However, it again approached the high court alleging that SpiceJet had failed to pay in accordance with the settlement terms. The matter is still pending before the Delhi High Court. SpiceJet has faced insolvency petitions from several of its creditors, including Willis Lease, Aircastle Ireland Ltd, Wilmington and Celestial Aviation. The NCLT rejected the pleas of Willis Lease Finance and Wilmington Trust. Spicejet settled the case with Celestial Aviation. The petitions filed by Aircastle and Alterna Aircraft are pending before the insolvency tribunal.

Unlike the past few years, when the corporates had sufficient cash surplus on their balance sheet, they have started looking for credit to fund working capital requirements and capacity expansion, he told PTI in an interview. ”Now we have come to a stage where they (corporates) have started approaching banks for augmenting their capacity or for working capital purposes. Of course, this I can say with confidence because when we look at our unavailed term loan percentage, it has come down from 25 per cent to 18 per cent and when we see the working capital utilisation, even that has improved,” he said. So, all these are confirming that private sector opportunities are going to be there and SBI will be in a position to create value for the sector, he said.

With regard to Retail Agriculture and MSME (RAM) lending, Khara said, SBI can grow the book at 16 per cent during this year as well despite the high interest rate.SBI reported a 16 per cent growth rate in RAM to about Rs 21 lakh crore during FY24. Emphasising that the bank has a very elaborate process of assessing the risk and underwriting RAM, he said that the current book looks pretty good. ”We don’t have any challenges, he said, adding, ”We can comfortably grow 16 per cent as far as our RAM book is concerned. We don’t envisage that the interest rate impact will be seen in terms of the quality of the loan book. ”When we are making assessment for underwriting, we are quite cognizant of the likely interest rate scenario, and the ability of the borrowers to repay loan in time. That is the reason why our RAM book has not witnessed much challenge and we can afford to continue at 16 per cent,” he said. Asserting that there is no stress on housing and vehicle loans, Khara said, the gross NPA in the whole retail portfolio is 0.7 per cent. ”It is nothing but a reflection of our underwriting standards and our ability to pick the right quality business. We are seeing adequate opportunities for us to underwrite mortgage and car loans. So I think we have not seen any challenge,” he added.\\n       ',\n",
       " 'State Bank of India Chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara has said there is a growing demand for credit from the corporate sector and loans worth Rs 5 lakh crore are in the pipeline. Unlike the past few years, when the corporates had sufficient cash surplus on their balance sheet, they have started looking for credit to fund working capital requirements and capacity expansion, he told PTI in an interview. ”Now we have come to a stage where they (corporates) have started approaching banks for augmenting their capacity or for working capital purposes. Of course, this I can say with confidence because when we look at our unavailed term loan percentage, it has come down from 25 per cent to 18 per cent and when we see the working capital utilisation, even that has improved,” he said. So, all these are confirming that private sector opportunities are going to be there and SBI will be in a position to create value for the sector, he said.

       " 'A joint venture between Reliance Industries\\' Jio Platforms and Luxembourg-based SES to provide gigabit fibre internet has won approval from the Indian space regulator to operate satellites there, a government executive said. The three approvals issued to Orbit Connect India - which aims to provide satellite-based high-speed internet access - come as companies from Amazon.com to Elon Musk\\'s Starlink have been vying for the go-ahead to launch satellite communication services in the world\\'s most populous nation. The authorisations have not been previously reported. They were granted in April and June from the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre, known as IN-SPACe. These allow Orbit Connect to operate satellites above India, but further approvals are needed by the country\\'s department of telecoms to begin operations. Reliance, which owns Jio, did not respond to an email seeking further details. Inmarsat, another company hoping to provide high-speed satellite-based internet, has also gotten approval to operate satellites over India, IN-SPACe chairman Pawan Goenka told Reuters. Two other companies, Elon Musk\\'s Starlink and Amazon.com\\'s Kuiper, have applied. Eutelsat\\'s Bharti Enterprises-backed OneWeb was given all of its approvals late last year. India\\'s satellite broadband service market is expected to grow 36% per year over the next five years and reach $1.9 billion by 2030, according to the consultancy Deloitte. Globally, the race to connect rural areas of the world via space-based internet is accelerating. Amazon plans to invest $10 billion in Kuiper, which was announced in 2019, the year SpaceX began deploying its first operational Starlink satellites. Last week, Sri Lanka gave Starlink preliminary approval to provide internet services there. Goenka said the more companies were involved in the sector in India, the better off consumers would be. \"Comparatively low pricing of communication services in India will compel global players to drive innovation to reduce their pricing,\" said Goenka, the former managing director of automaker Mahindra & Mahindra. \"This is already being done in many industries like automotive, where multinational OEMs had to innovate to meet the expectations of Indian consumers of high performance and low cost.\" IN-SPACe will also soon authorise private companies to operate ground stations, he said, which would enable satellite operators to download data as they pass over India. Prime Minister Modi\\'s government, which just won a rare third term, has been pushing the development of India\\'s space industry. This year, it opened the gates for foreign direct investment in the sector, saying outside companies could invest in the manufacture of components and systems or sub-systems for satellites up to 100% without approval. As a result, investors\\' interest has \"significantly increased\", Goenka said. \"Last year investments into private companies were $2 million-$7 million. This year they are talking $20 million-$30 million,\" he said. \"The proof of concept has happened.\" Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

The appointment has been made with effect from June 8, 2024, according to a recent regulatory filing. Suraksha Group, which has taken control of Jaypee Infratech ltd (JIL) after approval from the appellate tribunal NCLAT last month, will delist JIL from stock exchanges. The Board of Directors has fixed June 21, 2024, as the Record Date for determining the names of the shareholders to whom the exit price will be paid for the purpose of delisting and subsequent extinguishment of issued equity shares of the company. However, the shares issued to Suraksha Group (Successful Resolution Applicant) in terms of the approved resolution plan will not be extinguished. Suraksha Group has infused Rs 125 crore equity fund in JIL, as part of its resolution plan to settle banks' dues and complete 20,000 unfinished flats across various projects in Delhi-NCR. Earlier this month, Mumbai-based Suraksha Group took control of JIL by constituting a three-member board. The takeover followed the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) decision on May 24, upholding Suraksha Group's bid to acquire JIL. The NCLAT had directed Suraksha Group to pay an additional Rs 1,334 crore to Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) as farmers' compensation. Sudhir V Valia, promoter of Suraksha Group, has been appointed as a Non Executive Director on the JIL board. Aalok Champak Dave has been appointed as Executive Director and Usha Anil Kadam as independent director. Upholding the National Company Law Tribunal's (NCLT) decision of March 2023, the NCLAT on May 24 had said the decision was made to avoid any further delay in the implementation of the resolution plan and also to take care of the interests of all stakeholders, including home buyers and claim of YEIDA for additional compensation of the farmers. The corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) against JIL was started in August 2017, over an application by the IDBI Bank-led consortium. On March 7 last year, the NCLT approved the bid of the Suraksha groupto buy JIL. However, many parties, including YEIDA, filed petitions in the NCLAT to challenge the NCLT order. In its final resolution plan, the Suraksha group offered to bankers more than 2,500 acres of land and nearly Rs 1,300 crore by way of issuing non-convertible debentures. It also proposed to complete all stalled projects over the next four years. Lenders of Jaypee Infratech had submitted a claim of Rs 9,783 crore. In the fourth round of the bidding process to find a buyer for the JIL in 2021, the Suraksha group won the bid with 98.66 per cent votes. As many as 12 banks and more than 20,000 homebuyers had voting rights in the Committee of Creditors (CoC). The company had got 0.12 per cent more votes than state-owned NBCC, which was also in the fray. In the first round of insolvency proceedings in 2018, the Rs 7,350 crore bid of Lakshadweep, part of the Suraksha group, was rejected by the lenders. The CoC had rejected the bids of Suraksha and NBCC in the second round held in May-June 2019. In November 2019, the Supreme Court directed that the revised bids be invited only from NBCC and Suraksha. Then, in December 2019, the CoC approved the resolution plan of NBCC during the third round of the bidding process. In March 2020, NBCC got approval from the NCLT to acquire JIL. However, the order was challenged before the NCLAT and later in the Supreme Court. On March 21, 2021, the apex court ordered a fresh round of bidding between NBCC and Suraksha Group only.

Earlier this month, the Mumbai-based Suraksha Group took control of the Jaypee Infratech Ltd (JIL) by constituting a three-member board. The takeover followed the insolvency appellate tribunal NCLAT decision on May 24, upholding Suraksha Group's bid to acquire JIL. The NCLAT had directed Suraksha Group to pay an additional Rs 1,334 crore to Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) as farmers' compensation. According to sources, Suraksha Group has infused Rs 125 crore equity fund in JIL. Suraksha Group will soon start the construction process. It will also start making payment to YEIDA as per the schedule, they added. Suraksha Group has informed that May 24, 2024, the date of the NCLAT order, should be treated as the 'Approval Date' as defined in the approved resolution plan. Sudhir V Valia, promoter of Suraksha Group, has been appointed as a Non Executive Director on the JIL board. Aalok Champak Dave has been appointed as Executive Director and Usha Anil Kadam as independent director. Upholding the National Company Law Tribunal's (NCLT) decision of March 2023, the NCLAT on May 24, had said the decision was made to avoid any further delay in the implementation of the resolution plan and also to take care of the interests of all stakeholders, including home buyers and claim of YEIDA for additional compensation of the farmers. The corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) against JIL was started in August 2017, over an application by the IDBI Bank-led consortium. On March 7 last year, the NCLT approved the bid of the Mumbai-based Suraksha group to buy JIL. However, many parties, including YEIDA, filed a petition in the NCLAT challenging the NCLT order. In its final resolution plan, the Suraksha group offered to bankers more than 2,500 acres of land and nearly Rs 1,300 crore by way of issuing non-convertible debentures. It also proposed to complete all stalled projects over the next four years. Lenders of Jaypee Infratech had submitted a claim of Rs 9,783 crore. In the fourth round of the bidding process to find a buyer for JIL in 2021, the Suraksha group won the bid with 98.66 per cent votes. As many as 12 banks and more than 20,000 homebuyers had voting rights in the Committee of Creditors (CoC). The company had got 0.12 per cent more votes than state-owned NBCC, which was also in the fray. In the first round of insolvency proceedings in 2018, the Rs 7,350 crore bid of Lakshadweep, part of the Suraksha group, was rejected by the lenders. The CoC had rejected the bids of Suraksha and NBCC in the second round held in May-June 2019. In November 2019, the Supreme Court directed that the revised bids be invited only from NBCC and Suraksha. Then, in December 2019, the CoC approved the resolution plan of NBCC during the third round of the bidding process. In March 2020, NBCC got approval from the NCLT to acquire JIL. However, the order was challenged before the NCLAT and later in the Supreme Court. On March 21, 2021, the apex court ordered a fresh round of bidding between NBCC and Suraksha Group only.

       " 'A federal judge moved to untangle the complex bankruptcy case of a Byju’s unit by offering to rule out the arrest of a Florida hedge fund manager if he helps locate $533 million that the Indian tech company allegedly tried to hide. US Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey, during a court hearing Tuesday in Wilmington, Delaware, agreed to drop an arrest order for William C. Morton, the founder of Camshaft Fund. Byju’s invested $533 million of loan proceeds with the fund last year, according to court records. The money was later moved to a UK lender and then to an unnamed, non-US entity affiliated with Byju’s. Lenders are trying to use the bankruptcy case of a Byju’s unit based in the US to recover the cash. The judge ordered Morton, who appeared at the court hearing via video from Dubai but didn’t speak, to return to the US and meet with lawyers for Byju’s lenders within 10 days. If the fund manager, whom the judge accused of fleeing the US to avoid answering questions, fails to show up, Dorsey said he will reimpose the arrest order. “We need to move this case forward somehow,” Dorsey said. The missing money is at the heart of a dispute between lenders owed $1.2 billion and the startup founded by entrepreneur Byju Raveendran. The education-tech company’s official name is Think & Learn Pvt. The cash belongs to a bankrupt shell company, Byju’s Alpha Inc., which is affiliated with Think & Learn and was taken over by the lenders after their loan defaulted. Morton’s attorney,\\xa0Pieter Van Tol, told Dorsey on Tuesday that the money manager, who is in his 20s, is willing to answer questions under oath and cooperate with lenders.

       " 'The scion of the billionaire Hinduja family rejected allegations he overworked an Indian nanny at his Swiss villa, saying it would’ve been idiotic to do so when she was like a “second mum” to his kids. Ajay Hinduja was testifying on the first day of the Geneva trial of a branch of one of India’s most prominent families, which stands accused of human trafficking and overworking household staff. Ajay Hinduja, his wife Namrata and parents Prakash and Kamal were all indicted last year by Geneva prosecutors for allegedly making their staff work up to 18-hour days without a day off at their villa overlooking Lake Geneva. “Someone who would make an employee work that hard would be an idiot,” Ajay Hinduja told the court on Monday. “She wouldn’t have been able to do her job properly if she worked 18 hours a day, 7 days a week.” “I am shocked that someone who we considered to be a second mum for our children, could accuse us of something as demeaning as human trafficking,” he said later in the hearing, testifying mainly in French. He said he wanted to thank the woman for her work for the family, adding that she’s still in touch with his kids and sends them Diwali greetings by phone. The family confiscated their staff’s passports and put to them work on short-term tourist visas repeatedly obtained on false pretenses, prosecutors say. Ajay Hinduja rejected that accusation and said the employees had contracts endorsed by the Swiss embassy in India and their visas were regularly renewed by Geneva cantonal authorities. Judge Sabina Mascotto immediately rebutted that characterization of events, saying checks showed the staff lacked the correct Swiss paperwork. Instead they only ever had French-issued, Schengen-zone visas, referring to the European travel area, which allows people to move without passport checks. Ajay Hinduja said his staff were allowed to come and go from the house as they pleased provided at least one of them was home at all times for security reasons. Asked about their salaries, which prosecutors say never amounted to more than a few hundred Swiss francs a month — a fraction of local wages — he said it was the Hinduja Group’s HR department that did all hiring and contracts, not him. On Monday evening, he said his lawyers and those for the three plaintiffs were “close” to reaching a deal that would see the staff withdraw their complaints. But even if an accord is reached, it should still mean the criminal trial will proceed.

       " 'Billionaire Elon Musk on June 11 warned iPhone maker Apple of committing an \"unacceptable security violation\" if it integrates OpenAI at the operating system level. In a series of posts on social media platform X, which is owned by him, Musk said, \"If Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level, then Apple devices will be banned at my companies. That is an unacceptable security violation.\" \"And visitors will have to check their Apple devices at the door, where they will be stored in a Faraday cage,\" the Tesla CEO said. Apple and OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.Don’t want it. Either stop this creepy spyware or all Apple devices will be banned from the premises of my companies. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 10, 2024 Earlier in the day, Apple announced a slew of AI features across its apps and operating platforms and a partnership with OpenAI to bring the ChatGPT technology to its devices.\\xa0 The announcements at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC 2024) on June 10 were aimed at showing investors that Apple was making progress in AI at a time when tech giants Microsoft and Alphabet have overhauled their offerings by leveraging advanced AI technologies. Apple said it had built AI with privacy \"at the core\" and it would use a combination of on-device processing and cloud computing to power those features. \"It\\'s patently absurd that Apple isn\\'t smart enough to make their own AI, yet is somehow capable of ensuring that OpenAI will protect your security & privacy!\" Musk said on X. Apple has no clue what’s actually going on once they hand your data over to OpenAI. They’re selling you down the river, the billionaire added. He also shared an Indian meme to take a\\xa0dig at the Cupertino-based tech firm. pic.twitter.com/7OgZAAdPf6 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 10, 2024  It was unlikely that anyone would follow Musk\\'s lead, Ben Bajarin, CEO of consulting firm Creative Strategies, said, adding that Apple was trying to educate people that private cloud was as secure as keeping data on a device. \"What (Apple) is trying to now add to the narrative is when (data) leaves and goes to the secure private cloud, it\\'s similarly taking that same user data anonymization and firewalling of that information to you.

       " \"The initial public offering (IPO) of travel aggregator Ixigo marks the 14th public market debut of venture capital (VC) firm Peak XV’s portfolio companies since the Covid-19 pandemic, and the third this year after the stock market listings of co-working space provider Awfis and insurance company Go Digit. According to sources, Peak XV’s cumulative shareholding in portfolio companies that are now listed publicly — such as Truecaller, Freshworks, Mamaearth, and Five Star Finance, among others — is currently worth $1.6-1.8 billion. Since the erstwhile India and Southeast Asia arm of storied VC firm Sequoia Capital broke up with the parent last year and rebranded itself as Peak XV, it has fully exited its positions in food delivery company Zomato and womenswear brand GoColours, landing multiples of 10X and 16X, respectively, for these investments.  In all, the VC firm has seen 23 IPOs in its portfolio since inception (including in its earlier avatar) which is the highest number for any venture capital firm in the region and has already distributed close to $5 billion in exits to its investors, said people aware of the matter. Peak XV did not offer any comments for the story. It held 59 million shares in Ixigo, which were acquired at an average price of Rs 11.32 apiece, as per the company’s IPO prospectus. The VC firm is selling 13 million shares via the offer — booking a gain of around 8X on the transaction, given the travel aggregator’s pricing of the issue at Rs 88-93 per share. Also, the tech investor sold 6.6 million shares in the Awfis IPO for Rs 253 crore at Rs 383 apiece —\\xa0 which was almost 3X its average cost of buying the stake at Rs 134.8 apiece. According to data from BSE, Peak XV — listed as a promoter of Awfis — still holds about 7.7 million shares in the company that are worth about Rs 353 crore. However, the VC firm didn’t sell any shares in the IPO of Go Digit. At the time of the issue, Peak XV held 9 million shares in the company which were acquired at the price of Rs 328 apiece. Go Digit shares were trading at Rs 342 apiece at the time of publishing. Peak XV told its limited partners (LPs) in March that its portfolio includes 42 companies with over $100 million plus in run-rate revenue, 20 companies with $200 million plus in revenue, more than 65 companies with over $50 million plus in revenue, and over 100 companies with $20 million plus in revenue. It has $9 billion in assets under management across 13 dedicated funds and has invested in over 400 companies to date. In March this year, Peak XV told investors it will launch a perpetual fund which will 'create a culture of high accountability and alignment with LPs'. Sources said at the time that this permanent capital vehicle will have the Peak XV team's own capital and not raise any cash from LPs.

Foxconn is expanding its India operations, notably in iPhone production, through other subsidiaries. However, Bharat FIH has not benefitted much from this expansion.

Welspun One, an integrated fund and development management platform, on Monday announced the successful closure of its second fund totalling Rs 2,275 crores, inclusive of co-investment commitments. This marks the largest domestic fundraise in this space, the company claimed. The capital was sourced from a diverse pool of about 800 Limited Partners (LPs) or investors, including high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth individuals, family offices, corporates, and domestic institutions. Welspun One's second fund has already committed nearly 40 per cent of its investible capital across four investments. It expects to commit the remaining capital over the next 3-4 quarters. This will add 8 million square feet to Welspun One's existing portfolio of 10 million square feet, taking their aggregate portfolio to around 18 million square feet, entailing a total project outlay of around USD 1 billion. Welspun One's focus for fund 2 is on new-age warehousing assets, such as urban distribution centres, cold chain, agro logistics, and port and airport-based logistics, the statement said. Balkrishan Goenka, Chairman of Welspun World, said, \\\"Our commitment to advancing critical logistics infrastructure is in perfect alignment with India's strategic objective of reducing logistics costs from 14 per cent to 8 per cent, thereby enhancing the global competitiveness of our industries.\\\" By making investments in essential infrastructure, he said the fund aims to streamline logistics operations and stimulate industrial growth. Anshul Singhal, Managing Director, Welspun One, said, \\\"Embarking on the exploration of new-age warehousing assets represents an exciting journey for us at Welspun One. Our progress has been remarkable, having successfully established a well-capitalized platform poised to achieve an AUM of over USD 1 billion.\\\" Welspun One had raised Rs 500 crore in its first fund. Till date, Welspun One's first fund is fully committed with six investments, aggregating to a development potential of 7.2 million square feet across 300 acres of land in five cities. Currently, about 50 per cent of this is already delivered, with the remaining 50 per cent scheduled for delivery over the next 4-6 quarters. The portfolio includes clients such as Tata Croma, Delhivery, FM Logistics, Asian Paints, and Ecom Express, amongst others. Welspun One is the warehousing platform of the USD 5 billion global conglomerate Welspun World, which is one of India's fastest-growing multinationals with a leadership position in line pipes, home textiles, infrastructure, advanced textiles, and flooring solutions.\\n       \",\n          \"Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited (ZEEL) on June 17 said that it has appointed Mukund Galgali as the acting chief financial officer (CFO) of the company after its current CFO Rohit Kumar Gupta decided to step down from his position due to personal reasons.
