"TCS chief cautious of economic slowdown, but remains confident of future growth","Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) stays cautious about the possibilty of an economic slowdown, with chief executive K Krithivasan stating that the worst may not be over yet, though he sounded confident of growth as the company sits on a strong order book of $42.7 billion and aims to outperform its last year's performance in FY25. In an interview with Mint, Krithivasan highlighted the ongoing uncertainty in key markets such as the US, Western Europe, and the UK, where clients are re-evaluating their spending and making quick adjustments. ""It would not be appropriate to say that the worst is behind us,"" Krithivasan remarked. ""We do not have the comfort or confidence to make such a statement at this time."" The cautious outlook follows TCS's report of a 1.93 percent sequential dollar revenue growth in the April-June quarter, surpassing analysts' expectations. The company's headcount also increased by 5,452 from the previous quarter, reversing a year-long trend of workforce reductions. This positive news drove TCS shares up nearly 7 percent on Friday. Also Read | Short Call: One TCS does not make a summer For FY24, TCS achieved a revenue of $29.1 billion, reflecting a 4.1 percent growth, which is the second-slowest annual growth rate since its IPO in August 2004. The slowest growth was recorded in the pandemic year of FY21 at 0.7 percent. Mint quoted analyst Keith Bachman from BMO Capital Markets, saying that while the IT services sector's estimates seem to be stabilising, there is still not enough conviction to predict a significant improvement in CY25 growth. Tata Consultancy Services has maintained its earlier view that the current year will improve over the last, driven by growth across global operations and strength in major business verticals. ""There's nothing new to add in terms of market sentiments. However, as mentioned last quarter, we anticipate FY25 to surpass FY24, and we maintain that stance. We believe it will be a stronger FY25 compared to FY24,"" he said at a press conference to discuss the June quarter numbers. Also Read | Investors of TCS, HCL should tally their optimism with ISG index Krithivasan, in conversation with Mint, also addressed concerns about Generative AI (GenAI), dismissing fears that it would render many jobs obsolete. Citing Roy Amara's adage about technology's impact being overestimated in the short term and underestimated in the long term, he emphasised that while GenAI will transform certain areas, it will not eliminate the need for human workers. ""Unlike some past technologies like Blockchain, GenAI has a much larger impact,"" Krithivasan said, predicting that future coding practices will evolve significantly, but the demand for human talent will remain strong. In contrast to Accenture Plc, which reported winning $2 billion in GenAI deals in the first nine months of its fiscal year, TCS has not quantified its business from AI tools. However, Krithivasan asserted that TCS is not lagging, as the company is integrating AI into nearly all aspects of its operations. ""The key is how we are helping or bringing differentiation for our clients. We should resist riding on a particular hype cycle and focus on how we can help our clients,"" he stated.

Morning Scan: All the big stories to get you started for the day,"#1. India dedicated funds see record inflows of $1.25 billion in July second week Funds dedicated to India witnessed record inflows in the past few weeks, the Hindu Businessline reported. Last week saw inflows of $1.25 billion, with most of the money coming into exchange traded funds at $848 million, data from EPFR and Elara Securities showed. A good portion came in from Ireland while consistent inflows were seen from the US, Japan and Luxembourg. South Korea has also been a steady contributor. Why it’s important: Overseas investors are convinced of India’s continued growth story. The inflows into dedicated funds have gathered pace since April last year, when there was a shift from China to India. #2. Flipkart plans to open 100 dark stores, intensifying battle for market share in quick commerce E-commerce firm Flipkart plans to open nearly 100 dark stores in top cities ahead of its Big Billion Days sale, intensifying the battle over quick commerce, the Economic Times reported. The Walmart-owned company will take on Zepto, Zomato’s Blinkit and Swiggy Instamart this festive season. Why it’s important: The rapid penetration of quick commerce could see the segment corner a large chunk of festival season sales and Flipkart wants a piece of that action. The expansion of faster deliveries into non-grocery segments is expected to gather pace. #3. Care Health Insurance challenges regulatory power to set stock options to top executives Rashmi Saluja-led Care Health Insurance has questioned the regulator’s powers to set stock options granted to insurance company executives, the Mint reported. Care Health wrote to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India that no action should be taken against it for awarding equity stock options to Saluja despite the regulator rejecting its proposal. Why it’s important: This could potentially delay the Burman family’s bid to take over Religare Enterprises, the parent of Care Health Insurance. The Burmans have warned Care of legal consequences if it did not act to prevent Saluja from cashing in the stock options. #4. Indian talent needs to play role in chip design and not just fabrication, semicon influencer says India has the potential to “rise and emerge” as a major player in the next big semiconductor wave because its human capital is already driving technology giants Intel, Qualcomm and Nvidia, Lip-Bu Tan, one of the most influential global voices in the multibillion-dollar chip industry, told the Economic Times. Tan will attend the launch of Yali Capital, a local deep-tech venture fund with a strong emphasis on chip design. Why it’s important: The government has been aiming to make India a hub for semiconductors, but the country needs to play to its strength and focus on value additions such as chip design instead of fabrication, which is capital intensive, power guzzling and riskier. #5. Adani Power, NTPC and JSW Energy in race to acquire bankrupt Sinnar Thermal Adani Power, JSW Energy, Jindal Power, Vedanta Group, Torrent Power and state-owned NTPC are among 15 firms that have submitted expressions of interest for providing a resolution plan to take over the debt-laden Sinnar Thermal Power near Nashik in Maharashtra, the Economic times reported. The 1,350 MW power plant, a unit of RattanIndia Power, was initially developed by Indiabulls Power. Why it’s important: This is a rare instance of an electricity generator being readily available in India, where building a new power project is both costly and time-consuming. No wonder there is such ample interest. #6. Steep decline in bond issuances by India Inc in June quarter due to polls, rate cut hopes Corporate bond issuances slumped in the April-June period due to the national election and expectations of a drop in yields due to anticipated rate cuts, the Mint reported. The number of issues fell to 247 from 287. Listed bond issuances through the electronic debt bidding platform (EBP) saw a sharp drop in the total amount raised in the fiscal first quarter to about Rs 1.6 lakh crore from Rs 2.42 lakh crore a year ago, according to BSE and NSE data. Why it’s important: Part of the decline was due to the high base of the year-ago period. There could be a revival in the ongoing quarter as yields remain attractive and there’s strong investor appetite for long-term bond instruments from top-rated private sector issuers. #7. Government to take measures to help exporters grappling with non-tariff barriers The central government is working towards a strategy to tackle non-tariff barriers faced by exporters by setting up a committee and launching a portal, the Business Standard reported. The development comes at a time when India is negotiating free-trade agreements with several developed economies. Why it’s important: Wealthy nations often undertake non-tariff measures related to environment and sustainability that have become a cause for concern for Indian exporters. Non-tariff barriers typically take several years to resolve. #8. Metal and power producers lobby for easier vias regime for expats like those in PLI sectors Domestic metal and power producers have asked the federal government for a visa regime for expats, including those from China, on par with that for firms in the 14 sectors under the flagship production-linked incentive schemes, the Economic Times reported. Why it’s important: There are early signs of private capital formation in metals and power industries. The government could favorably consider easing the visa regime since delays in processing entry permits for foreign experts has emerged as a bottleneck. #9. Banks step up measures to contain the huge increase in mule accounts in recent months Commercial banks in the country have stepped up their control mechanism in taking on new current and savings accounts customers while boosting surveillance on existing ones, the Business Standard reported. This comes in the wake of an increase in the number of so-called mule account in the past six-nine months, bankers said. Why it’s important: India has one of the most stringent KYC norms for the finance and banking sector. The illegal or mule accounts have been rising despite that and the lenders are acting on the urging of the banking overseer. #10. Super sports Sunday sees superb sales for restaurants and bars across in India Sports enthusiasts nation­wide enjoyed an action-packed super Sunday, igniting a surge in business for restaurants and bars, the Business Standard reported. The day kicked off with the Wimbledon finals televised in India at 6.30 pm, followed by the Euro Cup finals starting at 12.30 am and concluding with the Copa América final in the early hours of Monday. Why it’s important: It was a blockbuster Sunday for eateries and bars, who had stocked up in anticipation. There was a spike in home deliveries as well.

Adani plans to build port in Vietnam to tap trade opportunities,"Billionaire Gautam Adani plans to build a port in Vietnam as the Indian conglomerate seeks to develop infrastructure overseas to tap opportunities from increasing trade. Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. has secured an “in-principle approval from the Vietnamese government” for a greenfield development in Da Nang, Karan Adani, managing director of the company, said in an interview. The project, which will have container terminals and multipurpose berths to handle various types of cargo, is at an early stage of planning and the total investment required hasn’t been finalized yet, he said. This will be the fourth international port asset for the Adani group after Haifa in Israel, Colombo in Sri Lanka and the Port of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. On Friday, Adani’s new mega port in southern India saw the arrival of its maiden mother ship and the company wants to accelerate the expansion of the facility in a bid to grab a bigger share of the international maritime trade that’s currently dominated by China. “The idea is to make India a maritime hub,” Karan, the elder son of Gautam Adani, said. “We are targeting countries that are high on manufacturing or high on population, which will lead to high consumption. We are focusing on export volumes in these countries.” Adani Ports is the largest port operator in India. It gets about 5% of its total volume from international operations and wants to increase the ratio to 10% by 2030, Karan Adani said. The company is looking at opportunities in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, East Africa, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Vietnam and Cambodia as these are regions where trade is coming to India, he said.

"Oil rises on cooling US inflation, strong summer demand","Oil prices rose in early Asian trading hours on Friday as signs of strong summer demand and easing inflationary pressures in the world's biggest oil market, the United States, bolstered investor confidence. Brent crude futures rose 37 cents, or 0.4%, to $85.77 a barrel by 0031 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 50 cents, or 0.6%, to $83.12 a barrel. Both contracts gained in the prior two sessions, but Brent futures were set to decline about 1% week-over-week after four consecutive weeks of gains. WTI futures were virtually unchanged on a weekly basis. U.S. gasoline demand was at 9.4 million barrels per day (bpd) in the week ended July 5, the highest for the week that includes the Independence Day holiday since 2019, government data showed on Wednesday. Jet fuel demand on a four-week average basis was at its strongest since January 2020, according to the data. Strong fuel demand encouraged U.S. refiners to ramp up activity and draw from crude oil stockpiles, supporting prices. U.S. Gulf Coast refiners' net input of crude rose last week to more than 9.4 million bpd for the first time since January 2019, government data showed. WTI front-month futures recorded their steepest premium to the next-month contract since April, a signal of near-term supply tightness. U.S. government data on Thursday showed an unexpected decline in consumer prices in June, stoking hopes that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates soon. The prospect of easing monetary policy has helped boost sentiment across the commodities sector, ANZ analyst Daniel Hynes wrote in a note. A weaker U.S. dollar has also increased investor appetite, he added. The U.S. dollar index slipped lower for a third consecutive session on Friday, as market participants raised their bets for a September U.S. interest rate cut.

Tesla delays Robotaxi rollout in blow to Elon Musk’s autonomy drive,"Tesla Inc. is postponing its planned robotaxi unveiling to October to allow teams working on the project more time to build additional prototypes, according to people familiar with the decision. The roughly two-month delay has been communicated internally, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information hadn’t been publicly announced. The design team was told this week to rework certain elements of the car, one of the people said. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk set the initial Aug. 8 date for the event months ago, and optimism about the spectacle has contributed to an 11-day streak of gains that added more than $257 billion to Tesla’s market capitalization. The stock fell as much as 8.3% in intraday trading Thursday after Bloomberg News first reported the delay. The idea of creating an autonomous taxi service has been kicking around Tesla for years, dating at least as far back as when Musk authored a second “master plan” for the company in 2016. The CEO has prioritized the project in recent months over work on an electric vehicle cheaper than Tesla’s most affordable car, the Model 3 sedan. Musk has talked up Tesla’s work on autonomous-vehicle technology for over a decade and convinced customers to pay thousands of dollars for a suite of features the company markets as Full Self-Driving, or FSD. The name is a misnomer — FSD requires constant supervision and doesn’t render Teslas autonomous — but Musk and top engineers have been increasingly bullish about FSD in recent months as the company’s vehicle sales have slowed. Tesla delivered 6.6% fewer cars in the first half of the year, despite the company adding a new model — the Cybertruck — to its lineup. The automaker also produced 14% fewer vehicles in the second quarter than it did a year earlier to help curtail swelling inventory.

Hindustan Zinc gets power supply from Serentica 180 MW solar project,"Vedanta group firm Hindustan Zinc on Thursday said it has started receiving power supply from Serentica Renewables. The renewable energy is being used for Hindustan Zinc’s operational business units in Rajasthan. ”On Global Energy Independence Day, Hindustan Zinc… announced the commencement of the first phase of renewable energy integration from Serentica Renewables,” the Vedanta group firm said in a statement.

"PepsiCo quarterly revenue misses on slowing demand for snacks, sodas","PepsiCo missed expectations for second-quarter revenue on Thursday as a series of price hikes and competition from private-label brands slowed sales of its snacks and soda mainly in the United States, its largest market. Analysts have said that product prices, which are starting to normalize almost after two years of multiple hikes, are still higher than the pre-pandemic levels, giving packaged-food companies such as PepsiCo little room to raise prices as volumes shrink. PepsiCo raised average prices on its products by 5% for the quarter ended June 15, in line with the first quarter. However, overall organic volumes slipped 3%.Data from NielsenIQ showed sales at Frito-Lay North America, the company's snacking business that sells Lay's and Doritos chips, fell nearly 1.3% in the four weeks ended June 15, while the overall salty snacks category in the United States saw a smaller 0.7% decline. Frito-Lay North America, which contributed about 27% to PepsiCo's total revenue in fiscal 2023, is the company's second-largest business after North America beverages unit, which accounted for about 30% of overall sales. Shares of the company fell 2.2% in premarket trading.Easing production and other expenses from pandemic peaks are giving companies some relief from a surge in costs.That and the impact of price hikes pushed up second-quarter gross margins by 120 basis points. The company's revenue rose 0.8% to $22.50 billion in the quarter, while analysts had estimated $22.57 billion, according to LSEG data.On an adjusted basis, PepsiCo earned $2.28 per share, beating estimates of $2.16 per share.

Pfizer was testing both a once-daily modified release dosing and also a twice-daily form of danuglipron.

ONGC higher on hopes of getting US waiver to lift Venezuelan oil,"Shares of Oil and Natural Gas Corp are trading higher after Reuters reported citing industry source that India's largest oil and gas exploration company has sought a waiver from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control to lift crude oil from Venezuela. The report said ONGC is optimistic of winning an approval, according to a source who declining to be named. Earlier this year, US had reimposed sanctions on Venezuela citing that the country had broken an accord to hold free and fair elections. India and even American oil refiners had increased imports of Venezuelan oil in 2023 after a six-month waiver from sanctions was announced, which ended in April this year. Oil from Venezuela was among the cheapest for India's oil refiners, with average landed cost reported at $60.60 a barrel in January this year. The Reuters report added that ONGC has been hopeful of recovering $500 million worth of dividends pending since 2014 for the stake it holds in Venezuelan projects. ONGC has instead sought oil instead of the pending dividend, however there has not been much progress on that front so far. Crude oil has rallied this year helped by supply cuts by OPEC+, though a volatility has declined to multi-year lows in June.

"Electric mobility startup Vidyut launches offline pre-owned EV sales, financing platform","Bengaluru-based electric mobility startup Vidyut on Thursday announced the launch of its offline pre-owned EV sales and financing platform. The latest offline services have been made available in Delhi-NCR, Hyderabad and Bengaluru to begin with, while the plans are to expand them into six more markets including Mumbai, Chennai, Pune, Lucknow, Agra and Kanpur by the end of this fiscal, Vidyut said. The company said it plans to launch an online marketplace as well in the next six months. Under the new offering, the company will manage the end-to-end process from vehicle inspection and valuation to sale and RTO documentation for the owners, the Bengaluru-headquartered firm said. Currently, the platform offers resale of electric commercial three-wheelers from brands such as Mahindra, Piaggio, Euler Motors, Greaves and Altigreen, among others, it said. ""Absence of a robust resale market is one of the biggest roadblocks in the acceleration of EV adoption. With the launch of our EV resale platform, we will be focusing on accurate and transparent vehicle and battery valuation. ""Coupled with our battery subscription model and EV financing services, this approach mitigates the risk of the remaining battery life, uncertain resale value, EV loans, thereby accelerating EV adoption,"" said Xitij Kothi, Co-Founder, Vidyut. Vidyut started in November 2021 as a commercial EV financing platform. One of the major hurdles in EV adoption is the lack of accessibility to resale market and resale price discovery of EVs and, therefore, over the last two years, the company has built capabilities to inspect, value, sell and finance pre-owned EVs through its own demand generation platform for used EVs, the company said.

"Aavas Financiers: EQT, CVC Capital & Bain in the fray as promoters Kedaara, Partners Group explore full exit","Top global private equity firms EQT, CVC Capital and Bain Capital have independently expressed interest in the ongoing mega stake sale in the works at Aavas Financiers Ltd ( formerly known as AU Housing Finance Ltd), three persons in the know told Moneycontrol. On July 3, Moneycontrol was the first to report that the twin promoters of the NBFC, Kedaara Capital and Partners Group, are weighing a complete exit eight years after jointly acquiring the firm more than eight years back. The report had added that due diligence was being conducted for the proposed deal and Jefferies had been appointed as the sell-side advisor. One of the persons above said a strategic suitor looking to expand in the financial services segment may have also evaluated the opportunity, but it was immediately unclear if the firm was still in the fray. When contacted, Partners Group , EQT and Bain Capital declined to comment. Email queries sent to Kedaara Capital, Aavas Financiers and CVC Capital were left unanswered at the time of publishing this article, which will be updated as soon as we hear from them. In recent times, other global investors like Advent International, Warburg Pincus, Mubadala and Ontario Teachers Pension Plan have also evinced interest in financial services deals or struck them. Torrent Group's Torrent Investments had expressed interest in the sale process of Reliance Capital under the insolvency and bankruptcy code. Kedaara Capital and Partners Group, classified under the promoter category, own a combined 26.47 percent stake in Aavas Financiers. If the entire stake is sold to an incoming suitor , it would trigger the open offer threshold as per Sebi norms to acquire an additional 26 per cent from public shareholders and result in a change in control. Based on the market cap of Aavas Financiers at the end of day's trade on July 10, which stood at Rs 14,290 crore, the stake owned by Kedaara Capital and Partners Group is worth Rs 3,782 crore. At these levels, a majority stake of at least 51 per cent stake in the firm is worth around Rs 7,287 crore. Incidentally, both Kedaara Capital and Partners Group have diluted part stake earlier in the year via the block deal route. In March, both firms divested 12.6 per cent in Aavas Financiers for Rs 1,369 crore. In an interview to Moneycontrol in April, Jean Salata, Chairperson of EQT Asia and Head of Private Capital Asia, named financials as one of the three sectors where EQT is considering deploying $5 billion in India this year. The other two segments are IT and pharma/healthcare. In the financial services space, Bain Capital backs Adani Capital, L&T Finance and 360 ONE ( formerly IIFL Wealth and Asset Management) . On the other hand, CVC Capital has not placed any financial services bets as yet domestically, even though the India team steered the acquisition of global online retail trading platform, currency data and analytics company OANDA.

SC stays Gujarat HC's order directing recovery of 108-hectare land from Adani Ports,"Supreme Court on July 10 stayed Gujarat High Court’s order directing the recovery of land allotted to Adani Ports in Navinal village, Mundra. A bench of justices BR Gavai and KV Viswanathan passed the order in an appeal filed by Adani ports against the recovery of around 108 hectares of land by Gujarat government. During the course of the hearing, Adani contended that the order was passed without giving them an opportunity to make submissions in the case, thus it needs to be stayed. The court thus passed an order staying the HC's order. The state HC had recently ordered the recovery of allotted land from the Adani group firm in a PIL filed by a person named Fakir Mamed and others a decade ago against the allotment of the land. According to media reports, Mamed is a resident of the village. The case dates back to 2005 when the 108 hectares was allotted to Adani Ports. In 2010, when Adani Ports and SEZ started fencing the land, residents of Navinal village there approached the high court with a public interest litigation and challenged the allotment of 231 hectares of grazing land to Adani Ports. In 2014, the court disposed of the matter after the state government said that an order granting 387 hectares of government land for grazing had been passed. However, when the allotment did not happen, the matter was revived in the court. Subsequently, the court asked a senior revenue official to draw a solution to the issue. The official responded that the state government had decided to take back nearly 108 hectares — 266 acres — of land that had been allocated to Adani Ports in 2005.

Tata Trusts forms executive committee to speed up decision making: Report,"Tata Trusts has formed an executive committee comprising Chairman Ratan Tata, Vice-Chairmen Venu Srinivasan and Vijay Singh, and Trustee Mehli Mistry, sources familiar with the development told The Economic Times. According to an ET report, the committee is formed to streamline day-to-day decision-making processes without necessitating full board approvals, addressing the complexity arising from over 18 trustees across multiple trusts. Tata Trusts, which holds a controlling stake in Tata Sons, the Tata Group’s holding company, has witnessed recent organisational changes. Aparna Uppaluri has resigned from her position as the Chief Operating Officer, citing personal reasons. Siddharth Sharma continues in his role as CEO since his appointment alongside Uppaluri in April 2023. The Trusts, endowed by members of the Tata family, including Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust, hold approximately 66 percent equity capital of Tata Sons. Ratan Tata, 87, serves as Chairman of Tata Trusts and Chairman Emeritus of Tata Sons. Tata Trusts is reportedly seeking a successor to Uppaluri as part of its ongoing efforts to restructure and transition towards outcome-based funding, focusing on scalable and measurable impact through public-private partnerships. Mehli Mistry, noted for his close association with Ratan Tata, joined Tata Trusts in October 2022 and has played an active role in trust management.

Gold rangebound with spotlight on US inflation reading,"Gold traded in a narrow price range on Wednesday as investors looked forward to a key U.S. inflation reading that could shed more light on the Federal Reserve's interest rates trajectory. Spot gold rose 0.2% to $2,367.79 per ounce by 0229 GMT. U.S. gold futures climbed 0.3% to $2,374.10. Fed Chair Jerome Powell in his testimony to the Senate said inflation had been improving in recent months and that ""more good data would strengthen"" the case for looser monetary policy. Powell will next speak before the House later in the day. ""With the recent run of weaker U.S. data, the case has been built around a September rate cut, but with the Fed Chair still wanting to see more good data, further inflation progress will be needed to offer more confidence for policymakers to open the door to rate cuts,"" said IG market strategist Yeap Jun Rong. Traders currently see a 73% chance of a rate cut in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool. Non-yielding bullion's appeal tends to shine when interest rates are lower. The June consumer price index (CPI) data, due on Thursday, is expected to show that headline prices rose 0.1% on the month, while core prices gained 0.2%. That would put annual gains at 3.1% and 3.4%, respectively. ""Any surprise resurgence in pricing pressures may challenge the Fed's inflation fight, which could raise calls for a delayed policy easing process. That may weigh on gold, which could see prices fall back towards the $2,300 level of support,"" Yeap said. Global physically backed gold exchange traded funds saw the second consecutive month of inflows in June due to additions to holdings by Europe- and Asia-listed funds, the World Gold Council said on Tuesday. Spot silver rose 0.3% to $30.89 per ounce, platinum steadied at $984.55 and palladium gained 0.1% to $981.37.

"Hyundai under pressure from Tata, Mahindra as $3.5 billion India IPO looms","Tata Motors Ltd. and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. are closing in on Hyundai Motor Co.’s No. 2 position in India, putting pressure on the South Korean automaker just as it prepares for a record $3.5 billion listing of its local unit. While Hyundai has long wrestled with Tata Motors for the second spot, Mahindra — famed for its big, brash sport utility vehicles — has been steadily climbing up the charts as Indian consumers embrace ever larger passenger vehicles. Hyundai sold 13.5% of all passenger cars in India last month, while Jaguar Land Rover-owner Tata Motors sold 13.2% versus Mahindra’s 12.4%, data from the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations show. Maruti Suzuki Ltd. is by far and away India’s top carmaker, with a 40% share.  The tussle for sales in India, one of the world’s fastest-growing automobile markets, comes just as Hyundai Motor India Ltd. plans to start gauging investor interest ahead of an expected initial public offering in September or October. An IPO of that size would also be one of Asia’s biggest in recent years. Hyundai is a “true leader compared to competitors, holding first and second rank in many categories,” Hyundai India CEO Unsoo Kim said during an investor presentation last week. But Chief Operating Officer Tarun Garg acknowledged that considering the many foreign automakers that have exited the country, “India is not an easy market to crack.” Hyundai is spending around 200 billion rupees ($2.4 billion) in India to develop electric vehicles — still a nascent sector in a country whose road transport industry is characterized by older, gas guzzling trucks and cars — and 70 billion rupees to get its second plant there operational by the back end of 2025. To woo consumers more interested in environmentally friendlier cars, it plans to launch an electric version of its bestselling mid-sized SUV, Creta, in the first quarter of 2025, according to the investor presentation. Tata Motors meanwhile is expanding its EV portfolio by adding 10 models by fiscal 2026. Mahindra plans to invest 270 billion rupees over the next three years to add capacity for making SUVs, as well as EVs. It hopes to launch nine diesel and gas-powered SUVs and seven EVs by 2030. Maruti Suzuki, although it leads India’s car market, currently doesn’t sell any battery-powered cars. “If some market share is lost by Hyundai, that can largely be attributed to product range,” said Deven Choksey, managing director at KR Choksey Shares & Securities Pvt. Tata Motors and Mahindra, with their appealing designs and competitive pricing, are “extremely challenging brands for all carmakers in India today,” Choksey said.

Mahanagar Gas hikes rates for CNG and domestic PNG in Mumbai,"Mahanagar Gas (MGL) on July 8 announced a hike in prices for CNG and domestic piped natural gas (PNG) in and around Mumbai starting July 9 to offset the rising input cost, the state-run firm said in a statement. The natural gas company will increase the price of delivered CNG by Rs 1.5 per KG, while domestic PNG will see a hike of Rs 1/SCM, the statement said. After this, the revised delivered price, inclusive of taxes, for CNG will be Rs 75.00/Kg and domestic PNG price will be Rs 48/SCM in and around the financial capital of the country. The state-run firm said the hike has been carried out to meet the additional cost incurred to import natural gas. ""To meet the increasing volume of CNG and domestic piped natural gas (PNG) segments and due to further shortfall in domestic gas allocation, MGL is sourcing additional market priced natural gas (imported LNG) which has resulted in higher gas cost,"" the firm said in a statement. The shares of the company closed 1.97 percent lower at Rs 1,666 on NSE. On June 22, Indraprastha Gas Ltd, the city gas license holder for the national capital and adjoining cities, hiked CNG price by Re 1 per kg to Rs 75.09 in Delhi. It, however, had not touched PNG rates, which continue to be Rs 48.59 per scm. ""Even after the above revision, MGL's CNG offers attractive savings of about 50 percent and 17 percent as compared to petrol and diesel, respectively, at current price levels in Mumbai, while MGL's domestic PNG continues delivering unmatched convenience, safety, reliability and environmental friendliness to consumers,"" the company said. The firm also added that ""even after the minor increase, MGL's price of CNG and domestic PNG are amongst the lowest in the country"". Natural gas pumped out of the ground and seabed is turned into CNG for running automobiles and piped to households for cooking. But supplies from state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC's) domestic fields have not kept pace with the demand. Gas from ONGC fields makes up for 66-67 per cent of CNG demand and the rest has to be imported.

Southwest Air names aviation industry veteran Rakesh Gangwal to board,"Southwest Airlines Co., which is facing demands for sweeping leadership and business changes from activist Elliott Investment Management, has named aviation industry veteran Rakesh Gangwal to its board. The addition of Gangwal, the billionaire co-founder of InterGlobe Aviation, which controls Indian budget carrier IndiGo, is the second defensive step taken by Southwest in response to Elliott’s $1.9 billion stake in the carrier, after last week adopting a “poison pill” shareholder rights plan. His appointment to the board is effective today, the airline said in a statement. “This appointment is part of the board’s deliberate efforts to evolve its composition to comprise professionals with a diverse range of skills and experience in areas critical to Southwest’s business,” the airline said. It’s added eight independent directors, including Gangwal, over the past three years. Gangwal is no stranger to discount carriers and the US aviation industry. Best known for co-founding InterGlobe , which is credited with generating the bulk of his wealth, he also helmed US Airways from 1996 to 2001, and spent a decade at United Airlines Inc. from 1984. He was chairman, president and chief executive officer at Worldspan Technologies Inc., a travel and transportation information services and technology company, from 2003 to 2007. Southwest’s lagging financial performance and insular culture have been focal points for criticism by Elliott, which said the airline has “written off” sources of revenue over the past 15 years that were adopted by rivals, including offering a bare bones economy fare and charging customers for checked bags and assigned or premium seats. Southwest Chairman Gary Kelly and CEO Bob Jordan have had “a stubborn unwillingness to evolve the company’s strategy,” Elliott has said. Elliott also earlier called for changes to Southwest’s board, including adding directors with external airline experience. “Rakesh knows the importance of building a business that has both a distinct culture and enduring profitability,” Kelly said in the statement. Under the “poison pill” adopted last week, the acquisition of at least 12.5% of the airline’s common stock would trigger the issuance of rights allowing existing investors to buy shares at a 50% discount. Such rights held by the 12.5% investor would become void, making it prohibitively expensive for Elliott to expand ownership and also diluting its stake in the carrier. Elliott has built an economic interest equal to about 11% in the carrier, but hasn’t reported its full position in securities filings, Southwest said. Southwest has pushed back at Elliott, saying it already had been assessing possible changes such as premium seating or revised boarding that it would unveil at a September investor meeting. But the airline had to cut its second-quarter outlook for unit revenue on June 26, saying it was struggling to adapt its revenue management system to changes in travelers’ booking habits. Gangwal, 70, and his family once controlled almost 37% of the Indian airline group. His decision to team up with Rahul Bhatia to create IndiGo in 2005 led to the rise of Asia’s largest budget carrier that’s now worth $20 billion, making it the third most-valuable airline in the world behind Delta Air Lines Inc. and Ryanair Holdings Plc and immediately ahead of Southwest. A subsequent feud and concerns over corporate governance led Gangwal to step down from the carrier’s board and pare his stake in recent years. Gangwal is currently worth $6.4 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

We are also grateful to DGCA for their continuous guidance, systematic review and approval of the harmonised operating manuals. DGCA has guided our teams with a safety-first change management approach which is congruent with the safety-first priorities of the TATA Group. The live tracker created by the Flight Standards Directorate of DGCA with a dedicated team for continuous monitoring of the progress of the harmonisation process has been instrumental in achieving the challenging task in a time bound manner,” said Campbell Wilson, Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director, Air India. Over the last 18 months, a team of more than 100 members have worked to align on the best practices and adopting common operating procedures. The result of this will be two separate manuals for the full-service carrier and the low-cost carrier. Air India and group companies are initiating the necessary crew training to action the harmonized processes, which will be another step in the direction towards building the new Air India and Air India Express. At present, the steel-to-software conglomerate fully owns three airlines -- Air India, Air India Express and AIX Connect (formerly AirAsia India) -- while it holds a majority of 51 per cent in Vistara. Singapore Airlines holds the remaining 49 per cent in Vistara. Over the last 18 months, a team of more than 100 members have worked to align on the best practices and adopt common operating procedures, Air India noted. In another development earlier in June, Air India Express relocated its headquarters to the Vatika One-on-One complex in Gurugram, now sharing the same campus as Air India's headquarters. This strategic move aims to enhance collaboration and synergies between the two entities.

""With our production capacity nearly doubling from about 2 million units to 4 million units by FY 2030-31, we plan to augment the use of railways in vehicle dispatches, close to 35 per cent over the next 7-8 years,"" Takeuchi stated. Maruti Suzuki has so far dispatched over 20 lakh units through Indian Railways. The automaker ferries vehicles to 20 destinations, serving over 450 cities using Indian railways. Takeuchi said the company pioneered the use of railways for vehicle dispatches over a decade ago by becoming the first company in India to obtain the Automobile-Freight-Train-Operator license. Since then, the company has systematically increased its share of vehicle dispatches using railways, he added. ""Through our sustained efforts in green logistics, we have achieved outstanding results including cumulative reduction of 10,000 metric tonne of CO2 emissions and 270 million litre of cumulative fuel savings,"" Takeuchi noted. The company stands committed to the country's net zero emissions target by 2070, he added. Earlier this year, under the PM Gati Shakti programme, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the country's first automobile in-plant railway siding at Maruti Suzuki's Gujarat facility. This facility has a capacity to dispatch 3 lakh vehicles per annum. The next in-plant railway siding is in progress at the company's Manesar facility and will be operational soon, the automaker stated.

Adani Green plans $9 billion infrastructure spend on green hydrogen in Phase one: Report,"Adani Group is planning to invest $9 billion towards manufacturing and transportation infrastructure at its green hydrogen venture in Kutch, Gujarat, business daily Mint has reported citing sources. The move will help the project aim at a capacity of one million tonnes per annum of green hydrogen in its initial phase, produced through the electrolysis of water using renewable power sources. Moneycontrol is yet to verify the report independently. The publication quoted sources saying that the plan includes deployment of specialised ships to export hydrogen to Europe and Asia. Initially, the project will utilise alkaline electrolyzers, with future plans to manufacture electrolyzers based on anion exchange membrane technology. This initiative is expected to generate between 7,500 to 10,000 new jobs and will be pivotal to Adani Group's strategic growth agenda, the report added. Simultaneously, Adani Green Energy revealed plans to invest Rs 1.5 lakh crore to scale up capacity to 30 gigawatts (GW) at its Khavda renewable energy project site in Kutch, Gujarat, over the next five years. The project is one of the world’s largest renewable energy initiatives covering 538 sq km of barren land, approximately the size of Mumbai. Currently, operations have commenced for 2GW of the planned 30GW capacity, within a year of project initiation. Chairman Gautam Adani underscored the conglomerate's commitment to energy transition projects, with plans exceeding $100 billion (approximately Rs 835 crore) aimed at manufacturing essential components for green energy generation. This includes establishing solar parks and wind farms for electricity production alongside facilities for manufacturing electrolyzers, wind power turbines, and solar panels.

Gig Workers and Large Companies: A symbiotic relationship under threat,"The Indian gig economy has emerged in the past decade as a powerful engine of economic growth. Since the surge in the startup and new-age platform companies over the past decade, many of them continue to provide jobs to these “gig workers”. These gig workers are typically unskilled youth and benefit both monetarily and in skills through this employment. Large companies play a pivotal role in transforming the lives of millions of these “gig” unskilled workers, as these people get employment and wages commensurate to their tasks, with flexibility in work hours. On the other hand, detractors of this gig economy point to many issues: lack of recognition of gig workers as employees, low and inconsistent wages, no pay transparency or guaranteed income, lack of benefits such as ESIC and PF, no social security or job security, opaque AI-driven employment decisions, long and unregulated working hours, inconsistent or arbitrary commission deductions and no predefined work environments. The gig and platform economy in India has witnessed exponential growth, driven by advancements in technology, increased internet penetration, and a growing demand for flexible work opportunities. The gig economy encompasses a diverse range of work, including ridesharing, food & grocery delivery, urban services, freelancing, and other on-demand services. According to a NITI Ayog report on “India’s Booming Platform and Gig Economy”, the rise of the gig economy in India is changing the face of the workforce. The current estimation for gig economy jobs in India is at 8 to 18 million, which is projected to increase to over 90 million jobs in the non-farm sector in the next ten years. In the next decade, the gig economy in India will be $250 billion or almost 1.25% of India’s Gross Domestic Product. The gig economy is a reality, and large companies and gig workers are responsible for each other’s success and growth, sharing a symbiotic relationship. The interdependence that binds them ensures a series of positive outcomes for both parties. Companies and policymakers should work towards: * Ensuring the long-term sustainability of the gig economy * Balancing economic growth with social equity * Promoting ethical and fair practices within the gig economy The above objectives are being achieved by large companies by: 1) Training and Upskilling Initiatives Unskilled labour in India often seeks opportunities to improve their livelihoods and fulfil their aspirations. Large companies play a crucial role in transforming this workforce by investing in upskilling initiatives. They provide gig workers with training programs, certifications, and access to online learning platforms, equipping them with in-demand skills and opening doors to higher-paying opportunities. Swiggy and Zomato, major players in food delivery, have introduced skilling programs to enhance the professional skills of gig workers. These programs open new avenues for personal and career growth, while also raising the standard of service across the platform. Similarly, Amazon India provides training in safe driving, customer service, and efficient package handling, empowering workers with valuable logistics skills applicable within and beyond the Amazon ecosystem. 2) Using Technology and Promoting Innovation In India, technology has significantly bolstered the gig economy by improving efficiency and expanding reach. Food delivery companies have utilized advanced route optimization algorithms to ensure timely deliveries while minimizing fuel consumption, reducing costs for gig workers. Similarly, Urban Company employs AI-driven tools to match customers with the best service professionals, enhancing earnings for gig workers. With the automation of tasks, Amazon, Flipkart, Delhivery, etc have streamlined tasks and made it less strenuous assignments. By continuously leveraging technology, companies are enhancing productivity of gig workers leading to higher earnings for the workers. 3) Worker Well-being and Better Work Environment Ensuring the well-being of gig workers is crucial for the sustainable growth of the gig economy in India. Large companies are increasingly recognizing the importance of providing a safe and supportive work environment. Initiatives such as health insurance, mental health support, and safety training are becoming more prevalent. For example, Zomato has introduced shelter rest points to combat worker fatigue. Amazon has been working to get the people working at its sites enrolled under two key government programs: E-Shram (Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana) and Health ID (Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana). 4) Side Stepping the Negative Voices The success of the gig economy model hinges on recognizing the interdependence between companies and workers, fostering upskilling initiatives, promoting innovation, and addressing the challenges faced by gig workers. As India's gig economy continues to evolve, a focus on collaboration and shared responsibility will be critical in ensuring its long-term success and positive impact on millions of lives. However, it has been seen multiple times that parties with vested interest prey on this partnership for their own commercial benefits. As India's gig economy continues to grow, a focus on collaboration and shared responsibility by policy makers, governments, and companies will be critical in ensuring its long-term success and positive impact on millions of lives. The nay-sayers with vested interests do not factor in the interdependence between companies and gig workers. The future of India's gig economy hinges on empowering the large companies to be transformative forces, upskilling the workforce, fostering innovation, and propelling economic growth. It is equally important for the labour work force not to fall prey to the narrative of the vested interests and derail the gig economy.

Morning Scan: Essential stories to kickstart your day,"#1. June quarter to see Nifty50 companies post double-digit revenue and profit growth The firms that constitute the Nifty50 index are expected to report double-digit growth in aggregate revenue and profit for the June quarter, driven by some companies in the automobile, banking and finance, and pharmaceutical space. The sample’s net profit is expected to grow 26.4 percent in the quarter, according to the Economic Times, which will be despite the high base of 36.2 percent expansion in the year-ago period. Revenue is likely to grow in double digits after a gap of four quarters by 10.6 percent compared to 6.9 percent increase a year ago. Why it’s important: The three months to June is traditionally a strong quarter for domestic cyclicals but the good show will be boosted by metals and healthcare firms. Geopolitical developments and slow growth in domestic consumption remain key near-term challenges. #2. Market concentration increases in key industries on business growth and acquisition Market concentration continued to increase in India’s key industries as top companies grabbed a larger share of the business in 2023-24 either through organic growth or acquisition, the Business Standard reported. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, a common measure of market concentration in an industry, reached a new high in the just-concluded financial year in industries such as telecom, airlines, cement, steel, and tyers. Why it’s important: Most industries in India have become either highly concentrated or moderately so. The trend is expected to continue due to a spate of mergers and acquisition in recent years and better profitability of larger firms. #3. Adani Group to invest massive $9 billion in capex in first phase of green hydrogen venture The Adani Group will spend $9 billion to build manufacturing and transportation infrastructure for the first phase of its ambitious green hydrogen venture, the Mint reported. Once production gets under way, the business group will hire specialized ships to export what will be the world’s cheapest green hydrogen and its derivatives to Europe and some Asian countries. Why it’s important: Adani’s green hydrogen plans are pivotal to the conglomerate’s business aspirations and crucial to the world’s third most polluted country’s net-zero transition. #4. Regime change in UK could derail Tata Steel’s plans for job cuts at Port Talbot factory The change of government in the UK could be detrimental to Tata Steel’s plans to pare jobs as part of its strategy to shut down ageing blast furnaces at Port Talbot plant in South Wales, the Hindu Businessline reported. Britain’s Labour Party, which came back to power after a decade, has made it clear that concerns around job cuts at the Tata Steel plant will be given top priority. Why it’s important: Tata Steel has been grappling with losses at the UK plant for several years. If the British government takes a hard stance on job cuts, the company will have to extend its losses. #5. Godrej Enterprises Group to map course to unlock growth potential with strategic plan The leadership team of Godrej Enterprises Group comprising the unlisted Godrej & Boyce and several closely held affiliates is working on a strategic plan with the Boston Consulting Group to create integrated and scalable consumer and industrial solutions businesses, the Economic Times reported. The group may consider creating separate scalable business units to drive growth. Why it’s important: Godrej Enterprises aims to tap into synergies offered by business adjacencies to hasten growth after a recent realignment of revenue streams and companies in the century-old Godrej Group. #6. Top startups may see stricter compliance norms on new digital competition regime Over a dozen top startups, including Zomato, Myntra and Nykaa, which command millions of users and large revenues, are likely to face stricter compliance standards under the new legal regime governing digital competition, the Mint reported. Besides MNCS like Alphabet and Meta, these local firms could also be identified as digital gatekeepers with significant influence over the market, according to a study by CUTS Institute for Regulation and Competition. Why it’s important: India is preparing to enact a new competition law to ensure fair play in digital markets, which would set specific thresholds that are expected to cover these homegrown companies. Setting the thresholds would be of critical importance in a country like India that has a strong smartphone penetration. #7. Central government may tweak new electric vehicle policy to benefit legacy automakers India is likely to make changes to its new electric vehicle policy to incentivize automakers that have already made investments in the country, the Economic times reported. The government may potentially consider investments in factories producing both internal combustion engine and electric vehicles as eligible for incentives to add scale and make large investments viable for automakers. Why it’s important: The development comes even as electric carmaker Tesla Inc is still to make any firm commitment on building a factory in India. The policy that aims to hasten local manufacturing of electric cars currently supports only fresh investments. #8. Cash-rich unicorn Zepto to supercharge management team ahead of initial public listing Flush with funds, quick-commerce unicorn Zepto is looking to strengthen its leadership ahead of its upcoming initial public offering in the next 12-15 months by hiring several senior-level employees across various categories, co-founder and CEO Aadit Palicha to the Business Standard. Zepto operates around 350 dark stores across top 10 cities and plans to expand the count to 700 in another 10 cities. Why it’s important: Quick commerce platforms in the country are growing at a breakneck pace, a development that was hard to predict even a few years ago. Finding the right talent for this new business space will not be easy. #9. Auditing overseer free to move against entire firm for alleged misconduct, Delhi high court rules The Delhi High Court has empowered the CA Institute’s disciplinary committee to act against an entire audit firm even when no single individual can be held responsible for the allegations in a complaint, the Hindu Businessline reported. Dismissing a batch of 10 writ petitions filed by partners from firms, including BSR and Associates, Price Waterhouse and Lovelock & Lewes, the court ruled that the committee is free to proceed against the firm as a whole or its individual members, as deemed appropriate, in response to allegations of professional misconduct. Why it’s important: This is a landmark verdict that will compel auditing firms to look closely at their business practices to avoid being censored. It would potentially boost accountability and transparency. #10. Budget could provide funding support to northeastern state to boost hydropower generation The upcoming budget national could unveil funding support to northeastern states for purchasing equity in hydropower projects, the Economic Times reported. The Centre could support equity participation by state governments in hydropower projects in the northeast at 24 percent of the total project equity, subject to a cap of Rs 750 crore per project initially. Why it’s important: Increasing hydropower generation is a key element in India’s green energy transition and reducing emissions intensity of GDP. Financial help to cash-strapped northeastern states would be a welcome move that will help hydropower projects that typically have a long gestation period.

Vedanta says it has arranged $250 million to settle Zambian copper mine debts,"Vedanta Resources Ltd said on Friday it has arranged the financing it needs to start paying creditors of its Konkola Copper Mines in Zambia as it takes steps to revive operations after regaining control of the assets. The miner owned by Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal will have around the $250 million it needs to pay small creditors in Zambia on or around July 8, it said in a statement Vedanta needs to settle debts owed by KCM as part of a deal reached with Zambian authorities after it regained control of the copper mines and smelter. The company regained control of KCM late last year after a five-year battle to recover the copper mines and smelter that were seized by the administration of former Zambian president Edgar Lungu which accused the company of failing to invest to expand copper production. Vedanta said it would also grant KCM workers a 20% salary increase and once-off payment of 2,500 Zambian Kwacha (about $102). Vedanta will still need to raise an additional $1 billion revive the mining operations and invest in advancing particularly the Konkola Deep Mining Project, which holds one of the richest copper deposits in the world. A Vedanta spokesperson told Reuters on Wednesday the company was committed to exploring all funding options, including via debt or selling a stake in the copper assets. Talks to sell a stake in KCM to the United Arab Emirates' International Resources Holding (IRH) collapsed after the parties failed to agree on the assets' value. Vedanta owns 80% of KCM and has said it may sell a 30% of its holding to raise capital to invest in boosting copper output. The Zambian government owns 20% of KCM through state firm ZCCM-IH .

Govt should review GST rates on vehicles powered by clean fuels: Rajiv Bajaj,"Bajaj Auto Managing Director Rajiv Bajaj on Friday suggested that the government review GST rates on vehicles powered by clean fuels. At the launch of the first integrated motorcycle Freedom 125 here, Bajaj also voiced concerns about the use of ”unsustainable subsidies” to promote electric vehicles (EVs). Earlier, he, along with Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari, launched the world’s first CNG-run bike in three variants at a starting price of Rs 95,000 (ex-showroom). ”I would call it a suggestion that the government should seriously review GST rates… Just as they’ve done the right thing with the 5 per cent GST for electric (vehicles),” Bajaj said. He said in the major two-wheeler markets in Latin America and ASEAN countries, the equivalent of GST was 8-14 per cent and almost without exception, the GDP per capita was equal to, or higher, in these countries than India. ”So, the aam aadmi (common man) of India is the one who can afford the least out of Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, etc. Then what is the logic, justification of 28 per cent GST,” he asked. According to Bajaj, there is no party happening in the EV segment as of now. Bajaj said the company has played its part by keeping the prices of the new motorcycle below Rs 1 lakh (at the lower end of the range) and was of the opinion that government should also now do its bit with lower GST. ”How can sustainable technologies be promoted by unsustainable subsidies, not only in India but worldwide… we want freedom from all of this,” he said. Terming the launch as a ”game-changer”, Bajaj said, ”Today, the message with the Freedom bike is Tiger Zinda Hai.” Speaking at the unveiling event, Gadkari said India has recently reached the third spot in the global automobile industry after the US and China. ”Our automobile industry contributes around Rs 3 lakh crore in terms of GST and employs around 4 crore people,” he said. The minister suggested that Bajaj Auto should ”make it (the vehicle) a 2-litre tank of ethanol, instead of a 2-litre petrol tank, along with the CNG tank.” He also urged the company to keep the price of the new motorcycles below Rs 1 lakh. This groundbreaking innovation will revolutionise the two-wheeler industry by providing a cost-effective and environment-friendly alternative to traditional petrol motorcycles, the company said. Bajaj Auto claimed that its Freedom CNG motorcycle offers about 50 per cent cost savings by significantly reducing fuel expenses, compared to similar petrol motorcycles. The CNG tank provides a range of 200-plus kilometres on just 2 kilograms of CNG fuel. Additionally, it has a 2-litre petrol tank that performs as a range extender, offering over 130 km of range in case the CNG tank empties, ensuring an uninterrupted journey. ”The Bajaj Freedom 125 showcases Bajaj Auto Ltd R&D and manufacturing prowess. Through innovation, Bajaj Auto Ltd has addressed the twin challenge of reducing rising fuel costs and reducing the environmental footprint from travel. ”The initiative also aligns strongly with the Government of India infrastructure projects of building a CNG network, driven by the need to use cleaner fuels and save foreign tourism exchange,” Bajaj Auto Ltd Executive Director Rakesh Sharma said. The Freedom 125 motorcycle will be produced at the company’s Aurangabad manufacturing facility, Sharma said, adding that the initial capacity will be 10,000 vehicles a month and the plans are to scale it up to 30000-40,000 by the fourth quarter of this fiscal. Sharma added that the company will look at exporting the bike in the next six months. ”Initially, our focus is, of course, India, which is a huge market. But, as we’ve been doing this, six countries come to our mind who have adequate network of CNG. These are Egypt and Tanzania in Africa, Colombia and Peru in Latin America, and Bangladesh and Indonesia in Asia,” Sharma added.

"DVC to invest Rs 20,000 crore in solar energy projects by 2030","Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) on Friday announced that it has planned to invest Rs 20,000 crore by 2030 to install nearly 4,000 MW of solar capacity, a top official said. The corporation, created for flood control and development in the Damodar Valley, envisions investment worth Rs 50,000-60,000 crore by 2030 to enhance thermal, pump storage power plants and solar energy, he said.It aims at adding nearly 10,000 MW in thermal and green energy, which will bring its total installed capacity to about 16,700 MW.Of the current 6,700 MW installed capacity of DVC, 6,540 MW is thermal. ”Power demand is growing strong in the north, south, and western parts of the country. We are expanding sustainably with the right mix of thermal and renewable energy, which will keep power costs affordable. We will add 3,720 MW in thermal capacity and nearly 4,000 MW in solar by 2030,” DVC Chairman S. Suresh Kumar said during an interaction on the occasion of the 77th Foundation Day of the corporation. The Kolkata-headquartered corporation now has only 14 MW installed solar capacity and is executing a 348 MW project in association with NTPC.A 250MW/hour capacity of battery storage is also under consideration, he said.Kumar mentioned that DVC has been exempted from coal import due to its power plants’ proximity to the pithead.Recently, the Union Power Ministry has extended a coal import advisory to domestic thermal plants for 4 per cent blending till October 15 to ensure adequate fuel supply during the monsoon season. DVC also plans to ramp up its captive coal mining from its Tubed block in Jharkhand with a separate railway siding for smoother evacuation.”With the dedicated railway siding for loading, we will be able to ramp up production to six million tonnes. We have proposed to the Railways that we would set up the facility at our cost. Due to current evacuation bottlenecks, our output is below two million tonnes. Captive coal is already cheaper, and if Coal India revises the price further, our coal becomes extremely affordable,” Kumar said.The maximum annual production can reach up to nine million tonnes, he said.”The current coal requirement of DVC is 28-30 million tonnes,” Kumar added.The rest of the coal demand is met from the supplies by Coal India subsidiaries. The corporation is unable to bid for a new coal block due to legal hurdles regarding a legacy case, involving a past joint venture with Bengal Emta Coal Mines, the official said.Kumar, who was the former West Bengal power secretary, stated that apart from the 4,000 MW solar power, the corporation plans to install two pump storage facilities in Logu Pahar in Jharkhand (1500 MW) and Panchet in West Bengal (1000 MW).The Panchet project is proposed to be a JV with the West Bengal government.Speaking about dues from Jharkhand, the DVC official said the old dues have come down to about Rs 1,000 crore, and the state is clearing the same.

HDFC Bank said to mull loan portfolio sale amid growth scrutiny,"HDFC Bank Ltd. is mulling the sale of a loans portfolio, according to people familiar with the matter, amid heightened regulatory scrutiny on the nation’s lenders as their credit growth surges. India’s biggest private sector bank has approached public sector lenders, non-banking finance companies as well as some insurance companies and asset managers about participating in the sale, said the people, who requested anonymity discussing private conversations. A measure of how much of a bank’s deposits are being lent out as loans — known as the credit-deposit ratio — has drawn scrutiny from the Reserve Bank of India as that gauge for the nation’s industry stands at a decade high. Selling some of its loan portfolio would go some ways to help HDFC bring that down following an increase in the wake of its 2023 merger with the bank’s parent HDFC Ltd. and may also aid its liquidity. The move is an unusual one for HDFC Bank, which is approaching the market with such a sale for the first time since the two firms combined, the people said. A spokesperson for Mumbai-based HDFC Bank didn’t reply to an email request for comment. Shares of the bank fell the most in a month on Friday after it reported flat sequential deposit performance in the quarter ended June. HDFC Bank Shares Fall Most in a Month After 1Q Deposits Miss With loans growing significantly faster than deposits in India, where the economy’s expanding toward 8%, decision makers at banks are under pressure to address potential financial risks that are building. India’s central bank has also asked banks to raise buffers for some consumer loans as it tries to keep a cap on evolving risks. The banking industry’s credit-deposit ratio stood at 80.3% in March, a decade high, according to RBI data. That has eased since, though remains elevated at 77.9% as of June 14. Bank deposits in India grew 12.6% annually through June 14, compared with 19.2% loan growth, the latest RBI data show. “The persisting gap between credit and deposit growth rates warrants a rethink by the boards of banks to re-strategize their business plans,” the Reserve Bank of India said in a monthly bulletin last month. “A prudent balance between assets and liabilities has to be maintained,” it said. HDFC’s credit-deposit ratio rose as high as 110% after the merger, according to a report by ICRA Ratings, the local arm of Moody’s Investors Inc. It’s since dropped to 104% at the end of the last fiscal year, though remains above the average of between 85%-88% in fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2023. The firm’s total loans expanded about 53% to 24.87 trillion rupees at the end of June, compared with a 24% expansion in deposits during the same period.

India’s hopes for Tesla investment cool as Elon Musk ceases contact,"India doesn’t expect Tesla Inc. to move forward with an investment in the country any time soon after executives at Elon Musk’s electric carmaker stopped contacting them, according to people familiar with the matter. Musk’s team hasn’t made any further inquiries with officials in New Delhi after the billionaire postponed a visit to India in late April, the people said, asking not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak publicly. The government is given to understand that Tesla has capital issues and doesn’t plan on pledging fresh investment into India in the near future, they said. The loss of interest in India comes as Tesla reported a second consecutive drop in quarterly deliveries globally and faces heightened competition in China. Musk announced major staff reductions in April, the EV maker’s first new model in years, the Cybertruck, has been slow to ramp up while construction of a new plant in Mexico has been delayed. Representatives from India’s Ministry of Heavy Industries, which oversees the automobile sector, and the ministries of finance, and commerce and industry, didn’t respond to requests for comment. Tesla also didn’t respond to a request for comment. Musk in April scrapped a planned visit to India that would have included a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, citing pressing issues at the company. He had originally announced his visit just weeks after India lowered the import taxes on EVs from foreign carmakers that pledge to invest at least 41.5 billion rupees ($497 million) and start EV production from a local factory within three years. Instead, India’s government is pinning its hopes on domestic automakers like Tata Motors Ltd. and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. to boost EV production, the people said. Should Musk decide to re-engage, Tesla would still be welcome to avail itself of the new import tax policy, they added. India’s EV market is in its infancy, with battery-powered cars accounting for just 1.3% of the total last year, according to BloombergNEF. Many buyers are hesitant to make the switch due to electric cars’ high upfront cost and a dearth of charging stations.

UBS loses another senior India banker with strategy yet unclear,"UBS Group AG’s India operation is losing another senior executive to competitors, at a time when the firm is still charting its strategy to manage wealth in the country, according to people familiar with the matter. Aditya Goenka, a Mumbai-based managing director in structured lending, is leaving to join HSBC Holdings Plc in its commercial banking business, the people said, asking not to be named as the information is private. UBS, which exited India’s onshore wealth business about a decade ago, is seeking to lean on the Credit Suisse team it acquired to make a comeback there. While margins in India are slimmer than other markets, the firm sees there is opportunity in managing both the business and personal assets of clients benefiting from the boom in the stock market and economy. Still, even as UBS draws up its plans in India, it has become a hunting ground for wealth managers and banks looking for talent in a fiercely competitive market, the people said. Since news of the UBS takeover broke last year, about half a dozen ex-Credit Suisse executives have left for other firms, according to reporting and calculations by Bloomberg News. Goenka has been at Credit Suisse for more than 11 years, according to his LinkedIn profile. He was previously with Bank of America Corp. for nearly eight years, according to the profile. Spokespeople from UBS and HSBC declined to comment. Goenka didn’t respond to messages seeking comment. At HSBC, Goenka will join his ex-Credit Suisse colleague Rajat Sabharwal who led its equities business in the country until the end of last year, according to his LinkedIn profile. Sabharwal is now in a similar role at HSBC, the profile states. Other Credit Suisse departees are Sudipto Sinha, an executive director, who is now a business head at Angel One Wealth, as well as Sandipan Roy, the head of product development, who is now the chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Wealth Management Ltd. Liechtenstein royal family-backed LGT Wealth India hired veteran relationship manager Ajay Punjabi as well as Chirag Doshi to lead its fixed income business. Vijay Shah, the head of advisory and sales in wealth management, also left the bank to start his own business, according to his LinkedIn profile. Credit Suisse had just over 40 wealth management employees in India, and around 7,000 people overall in the country, a spokesperson at the bank told Bloomberg News in April last year. About a month ago, UBS’ co-head for Asia-Pacific wealth management Jin Yee Young visited India, which she called a key strategic market. The firm is rebuilding in markets such as India, according to its Asia Pacific president Edmund Koh. “It’s a good market for us, but still early days in India, still a lot of heavy lifting to do,” Koh had said.

Want continuity of policy supporting EVs for next 8-10 years: Mercedes-Benz India MD & CEO,"Mercedes-Benz India wants the government to commit to continuity in policies that support electric mobility for the next eight to ten years, for stable and better planning towards zero emission mobility, its Managing Director and CEO Santosh Iyer said on Tuesday. Besides, the company feels that providing the incentives given to electric vehicles to hybrid vehicles will extend the timeline for transition to emission free mobility. The company, which had increased EV penetration to 6 per cent in the first quarter of 2024, from 2.5 per cent earlier, expects the momentum to carry going forward with three new EV models slated for launch this year, starting with the EQA next week. ""A much more clear roadmap when it comes to taxation on EVs,"" Iyer told PTI here when asked about the company's expectations from the upcoming Union Budget. ""We understand that the Budget may not address the GST topic, but at least if you are able to get a commitment that for the next eight to ten years, this kind of taxation benefit will continue, this will really help brands like us to plan long term and have more commitments when it comes to investments for the EVs,"" he said. For electric vehicles the government has already given 5 per cent GST compared to 48-50 per cent on internal combustion engines, Iyer added. Highlighting investment on infrastructure as another key aspect, he said, ""One of the biggest drivers for our growth has been the growing road infrastructure and intercity road infrastructure that has come up in the last couple of years."" He further said, ""one big line item that we will see in the Budget is the capital expenditure on infrastructure. We expect (it) to go up if possible, so that not only it helps demand but also the indirect benefits of it for the country also is great."" When asked about the discussions on extending the GST benefits given to EVs on hybrid vehicles, Iyer said, ""Currently we can see electric as the only option when it comes to zero emission driving. Now on that road, if we add newer technologies, it will delay the transition, for sure."" Iyer further said, ""It is up to the government and the stakeholders to see how soon they want to accelerate the transformation to carbon free mobility and emission free mobility."" On the company's roadmap for electric mobility, he said it is committed to zero emission mobility but ""the EV transition is a marathon and not a sprint"". ""We have already three (EV) products in the market with which we achieved 5-6 per cent penetration and we will continue with the EQA (to be launched next week) to further penetrate,"" Iyer said. Two more EV models will be launched later this year, he added. In the first quarter of 2024, the company had posted total sales of 5,412 units, growth of 15 per cent from the year-ago period. On local assembly of EVs in India, Iyer said Mercedes-Benz India will consider other models too depending on demand. It currently assembles EQS at its Chakan plant.

The Foxconn group company was already in trouble after the exit of three independent directors in the past three months. InterGlobe Aviation chairman Venkataramani Sumantran, Sify Technologies cofounder Ramaraj R and former IT and telecom secretary Aruna Sundararajan cited a lack of clarity in the company's direction as the reason for their departures. Bharat FIH has struggled to diversify beyond Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi, failing to compete effectively with rivals like home-grown Dixon Technologies, which has benefitted from the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, the report said. Moneycontrol couldn’t verify the report independently. The company’s inability to pivot quickly to other sectors exacerbated its woes, particularly as Xiaomi faces regulatory challenges in India, the report said. Foxconn is expanding its India operations, notably in iPhone production, through other subsidiaries. However, Bharat FIH has not benefitted much from this expansion. Bharat FIH has been hit by Xiaomi diversifying its manufacturing partners. It has promoted the firm to consolidate operations at its Sriperumbudur facility, which now focuses on diverse segments such as telecom equipment, EV components and displays.

""Kedaara Capital and Partners Group have been invested for many years, got the firm listed and have scaled it up. They are now evaluating options to monetize their balance stake to either a private equity or strategic investor,"" said one of the persons above. Incidentally, both Kedaara Capital and Partners Group have diluted part stake earlier in the year via the block deal route. In March, both firms divested 12.6 percent in Aavas Financiers for Rs 1,369 crore. A second person told Moneycontrol that investment bank Jefferies has been mandated as the sell side advisor. ""Three to four parties are conducting due diligence on the deal. It's a large cheque and affordable housing finance is a promising sector to look at, "" this person added, without elaborating on the names of the suitors. Two other persons also confirmed the stake sale plans and the ongoing process. One of them added that private equity interest was high in the proposed transaction. ""Let us see how the deal progresses. What if someone is keen on picking up less than 25 percent stake? But whoever enters will become the single largest shareholder in the firm,"" he elaborated. In recent times, the likes of Bain Capital, CVC Capital, Advent International, Warburg Pincus, Mubadala and Ontario Teachers Pension Plan have evinced interest in NBFC deals or struck them. All the four persons above spoke to Moneycontrol on the condition of anonymity. When contacted, Kedaara Capital and Partners Group declined to comment. Email queries and multiple reminders sent to Aavas Financiers and the firm's MD and CEO were left unanswered at the time of publishing this article. Jefferies couldn't be reached for an immediate response. A closer look at Aavas In February 2016, a Kedaara-Partners JV acquired Aavas Financiers Ltd for around Rs 950 crore, according to media reports. The firm was listed in October 2018 and its share price has risen by around 18.73 percent in the last six months. Some of the shareholders of Aavas in the public category include SBI Small Cap Fund (8.86 percent), UTI Flexi Cap Fund (3.06 percent), Amansa Holdings Private Ltd (3.10 percent) and ADIA (2.50 percent). For FY23-24, the NBFC had a net profit of Rs 490.69 crore and revenues of Rs 2,017.50 crore. It reported a 20 percent uptick in disbursements to Rs 1,890 crore during the January-March quarter. Assets under management also rose 22 percent to Rs 17,300 crore during the same period.

Currently, the firm is operating with a total of 371 branches, the website added. NBFC sector buzzing with deal activity Here's a slice of some of the frenetic deal action from the NBFC segment this year. In February, digital non-banking finance company Credit Saison (CS) India said Japan's Mizuho Bank acquired 15 percent stake in it for Rs 1,200 crore. Warburg Pincus- and Kedaara Capital-backed Avanse Financial Services, an education-focused non-banking financial company (NBFC), announced on March 26 that it has raised primary capital of Rs 1,000 crore. This round of funding was led by Mubadala Investment Company, an Abu Dhabi-based investment company, with participation from Avendus PE Investment Advisors Private Limited through its fund Avendus Future Leaders Fund II. Avanse later filed draft papers for a Rs 3,500-crore IPO. Top Chennai-based retail NBFC Shriram Finance announced the sale of its subsidiary Shriram Housing Finance to global private equity firm Warburg Pincus for Rs 4,630 crore on May 13. On December 14, Moneycontrol was the first to report that the listed parent had revived stake sale plans to unlock value in Shriram Housing Finance and launched a process to sell a controlling stake in the arm.

Tesla Sales: Only Musk’s Robotaxi can save investors now,"Tesla Inc is, according to its promoters — very much including Chief Executive Elon Musk — an artificial intelligence giant trapped in a carmaker’s body. That much was evident from quarterly sales and production numbers, and the market’s reaction to them, on Tuesday morning. Tesla made about 411,000 vehicles and delivered about 444,000 in the second quarter. This was better than expected, with deliveries slightly beating the consensus estimate and, importantly, outpacing production. Tesla’s stock jumped as much as 10% in response. The slightest of digging yields a somewhat less bullish interpretation. First, that consensus has been going downhill faster than a Cybertruck with pedal issues. Only a month ago, Tesla’s numbers would have missed. Moreover, even beating estimates meant a 5% drop in deliveries, year over year. On a rolling four-quarter basis, Tesla’s vehicle sales flattened out last summer and Musk in January explicitly abandoned the company’s previous growth target of 50% per year, compounded. The beaten-down consensus estimate implies sales dropping outright in 2024. With the first-half numbers now in the books, even hitting that forecast requires two record quarters in a row, averaging 487,000 deliveries apiece. Pending that next “growth wave,” Tesla’s core business, accounting for 89% of its gross profit, isn’t growing. Strikingly, sales of Tesla’s premium models, other than the mass-market-ish 3 and Y, were actually lower in the second quarter than in the fourth quarter of 2023. You may recall that is when the Cybertruck joined the Models S and X in the high-priced segment; meaning the addition of this third model hasn’t boosted those sales overall (which also came in a bit below production). Multiple recalls for the months-old Cybertruck probably haven’t helped fully offset the continued ageing of the S and X when it comes to attracting buyers, even as rival models proliferate and Rivian Automotive Inc, a serious challenger at that end of the market, has received a financial lifeline from Volkswagen AG. Deliveries of the mainstay Models 3 and Y, while down year over year, did come in higher than production. That cleared about 36,000 vehicles from inventory, which should mean better free cash flow in the second quarter compared with the prior quarter’s big burn. Yet, overall, Tesla only cleared about a quarter of its big pile of unsold vehicles that has built up since the second quarter of 2022. Moreover, it did so partly via further discounts and even resorting to zero-rate financing in China, which implies an effective price cut of several thousand dollars for those vehicles. Even then, preliminary data from China’s Passenger Car Association show a 24% drop in shipments from Tesla’s Shanghai factory in June, year over year. As much as these headline delivery numbers beat a hurdle that had been all but buried, the wider context suggests little prospect of turning around what should be the main story: another big decline in earnings. The consensus estimate for 2024 now implies a 22% drop from last year, which saw a 29% drop from 2022. Yet a car company with flattened sales in its core business, an aging lineup and shrinking profits has seen its market capitalization expand by about $275 billion since hitting a low point in April, with a fifth of that on Tuesday morning alone. As growth and margins in the existing business of making electric vehicles have faltered, the need for AI-related promises to pick up the slack has only intensified. Luckily for Tesla, in the face of repeated disappointments andstructural challenges to Musk’s robotaxi vision, investors remain eager as ever to pull on that rope.

Electric vehicle makers need to shorten design-to-market timeline,"By Faraz Khan and Saket Mishra  Technology associated with electric vehicles (EV) is rapidly evolving and by certain estimates total cost of ownership for EVs has already fallen below that of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Some reports suggest that EV sales in India contributed more than 5% of total vehicle sales between October 2022 and September 2023. As prices become competitive and charging infrastructure increasingly available, it is estimated that within this decade EVs could account for more than 40% of India’s automotive market and EV sales will likely cross $20 billion in the two-wheeler sector, $1.7 billion in the three-wheeler sector, and $ 16.5 billion in the four-wheeler sector (including buses). The government is incentivizing EV manufacturers by offering various incentives through schemes such as FAME and other production linked incentive schemes. A variety of EV products are being frequently launched in the market across segments. While late-stage funds are entering into partnerships with established automobile manufacturers, early-stage capital is placing its bet on start-up EV and battery manufacturers, amongst other allied businesses such as battery-as-a-service and leasing of EV fleets to last and middle mile operators. Compressing Design-to-Market Timeline With competition heating up, reducing the time required to take new products from design-to-market has become increasingly important. One key factor in this process is ‘homologation’ - i.e., obtaining a ‘Type Approval Certificate’ to ensure that a particular vehicle is roadworthy and matches specified criteria laid out by the government for public use of such vehicle. This article examines the process by which an EV or battery manufacturer can obtain a Type-Approval Certificate for an EV or battery product under the (Indian) Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 (MV Act) and the (Indian) Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 (CMVR and, collectively, the MV Regulations). As a general rule, EVs expressly fall within the ambit of the MV Regulations. 2W EVs that weigh less than 60 kgs (excluding the battery) with a top speed less than 25 km/hr and power less than 0.25 KW do not require homologation. Such 2W EVs will nonetheless attract liability for defects under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. All other EVs fall within the class of ‘battery operated vehicles’ as defined under the CMVR. Type-Approval for a New EV Like for ICE Vehicles, the homologation process requires an EV manufacturer to physically deliver to a ‘Testing Agency’ designated by the government, a prototype of the vehicle it seeks to have certified. The Testing Agency shall run such vehicle through a series of tests to determine if such vehicle meets the applicable Automotive Industry Standards (AIS). The AIS govern various aspects including manufacture, functional safety, energy consumption and range measurement of EVs and batteries. Every EV and battery manufacturer has to ensure that their products mandatorily comply with the AIS. Upon successful testing, the Testing Agency will issue a Type-Approval Certificate for the vehicle to the manufacturer certifying compliance with the MV Regulations.  A vehicle that is not type approved cannot be sold for public use and any violation can result in significant fines and criminal liability as well. Until recently, the Automotive Research Association of India, Pune (ARAI) was the prominent Testing Agency for all vehicles including EVs. In recent years, other Testing Agencies such as NATRAX, Indore, ICAT, Manesar and GARC, Chennai have also gained favour. Notified as late as 2019, some of these Testing Agencies offer state-of-the-art infrastructure allowing for efficient, timely and accurate testing. Obtaining a Type Approval certificate for an EV today can take anywhere between 6 to 12 months. However, with EV manufacturers having the ability to access more Testing Agencies in recent times, the time required to complete the homologation process and obtain type approval certificates for each model is expected to come down. Type Approval For Batteries / Other Components of an EV Manufacturers of batteries and other components for which standards have been notified are required to ensure that such battery or component meet the relevant safety standards applicable to the manufacture of such component. AIS 156 is one such safety standard that was put in place to avoid and reduce battery related fire incidents involving EVs. It applies to battery packs, charging infrastructure and battery management systems. Its implementation did, in the near-term, result in a requirement to re-certify certain components and increase in costs for manufacturers and suppliers. Implementing detailed safety requirements for EV products should only benefit the EV industry in the long term. The Bureau of Indian Standards has also formulated its own standards to ensure safety of EV batteries but these are not mandatory yet. If enforced, it may create further challenges for battery and battery related component manufacturers to ensure compliance with multiple sets of rules promulgated by different authorities. Using batteries that are type approved in an EV does not exempt a manufacturer from obtaining a separate type approval certificate for such EV once laden with such certified battery. In the case of unladen EVs (not carrying a battery), it is not only the vehicle that has to be type approved but also a prototype of the vehicle with the battery installed, prior to such vehicle being sold or put in public use. In fact, where a manufacturer decides to change the type or model of battery used on a previously certified EV model, such manufacturer will be required to re-submit such EV with the new battery to obtain a fresh type approval certificate. This would apply irrespective of whether such a vehicle is installed with a fixed battery or uses battery swapping. In conclusion, it is evident that any efficient ‘go-to-market’ strategy for a manufacturer of EVs, batteries and other components should take into consideration meticulous adherence to standards during the manufacturing process. This will significantly help avoid undue delay in the process of obtaining type approval certificates for electric vehicles. It is advisable for manufacturers to remain keenly involved during every type approval process for their products, such that questions raised by the Testing Agency are answered promptly and defects rectified swiftly.

M&M selects ABB India's paint technology for new EV facility; shares rise,"Carmaker Mahindra & Mahindra has selected ABB India’s PixelPaint technology for its new electric vehicle paint facility, the latter said in a stock exchange filing on July 3. The firm said the technology, which uses a paint head similar to an inkjet printer, will begin serial production in 2025. The share price of ABB India were trading 0.8 percent higher at Rs 8,582 on NSE at 12:46 pm. “Our revolutionary PixelPaint technology can apply large areas of uniform color as well as the tiniest details with complete accuracy, without delaying the production line or the need for manual intervention,” said Joerg Reger, managing director of ABB Robotics Automotive Business Line. “By deploying PixelPaint-equipped robots in dedicated cells, Mahindra’s paint shop will be able to apply finishes such as contrasting roof and pillar treatments on its new line of EVs in a completely automated process,” Reger said. According to the statement, PixelPaint consists of a paint head with over 1,000 tiny, individually-controlled nozzles, mounted on an ABB robot such as the IRB 5500 paint series. “Demand for personalization options has been growing in recent years, and PixelPaint is just one example of how ABB’s transformative technologies are helping to establish Mahindra’s products within the luxury segments,” the exchange filing said. The deployment will make M&M the first original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to use the technology for painting contrasting roofs and pillars, according to the statement. It builds on ABB and Mahindra’s existing relationship, which also includes 42 robots from IRB 5500 family, the firm said.

Mega sale of Advent-backed Bharat Serums & Vaccines: Who are the 3 suitors in the final lap?,"The ongoing big-bang sale process of private equity major Advent International-backed top biopharmaceutical firm Bharat Serums & Vaccines ( BSV) has boiled down to a three-way race, four persons in the know told Moneycontrol on the condition of anonymity. ""A consortium of Swedish private equity firm EQT and ADIA ( Abu Dhabi Investment Authority), domestic pharma major Mankind Pharma and a consortium of ChrysCapital, Warburg Pincus and Mubadala have been selected for the next round post submission of initial bids,"" one of the persons quoted above said. Moneycontrol was the first to report the sale plans of BSV on December 2. This was followed by a December 20 report that said investment banks JP Morgan and Jefferies had been picked as sell side advisors for the deal. Two other persons also confirmed that the above three suitors have been shortlisted for the next stage of the proposed transaction. They told Moneycontrol that the submission of binding bids is expected in mid-July. With BSV having an established market position in its product segments and strong R&D capabilities, Advent International is expecting a valuation between $1.5 billion to $2 billion for its portfolio company , as per the Moneycontrol report. A fourth person said the EQT led consortium and Mankind Pharma had been more aggressive in terms of financial bids and both parties were the frontrunners but also added that the ChrysCapital combine had more experience in striking deals across the pharma segment. When contacted, Advent International and EQT declined to comment. Email queries to ADIA, Mankind Pharma, ChrysCapital, Warburg Pincus and Mubadala were left unanswered at the time of publishing this article. In May, Moneycontrol reported that a clutch of global private equity funds had evinced interest in the BSV sale process. Mankind Pharma and ChrysCapital had joined hands earlier in the race for Apax Partners backed medical devices player Healthium Medtech, which was eventually won by KKR. Further, in an interview to Moneycontrol in April, Jean Salata, Chairperson of EQT Asia and Head of Private Capital Asia, shared that EQT is considering deploying $5 billion in India this year across sectors like IT, pharma/healthcare and financials. Incidentally, Advent is also exploring strategic options to unlock value in another portfolio company - India's largest rigid plastic packaging firm Manjushree Technopak. A sale process is in the works though Advent also wants to keep the IPO option handy, according to an earlier Moneycontrol report. A closer look at BSV Advent announced the buyout of a controlling stake in Bharat Serums in November 2019, providing a complete exit to the erstwhile investors, Orbimed Asia and Kotak PE. A partial exit was given to the founders, the Daftary family. Back then, the deal valued the firm around $500 million. Mumbai-based Bharat Serums and Vaccines Limited was set up in 1971 and is engaged in the development, manufacturing and marketing of biological, biotech and pharmaceutical formulations. According to a note by ICRA Ratings dated September 11, 2023, its product profile comprises plasma derivatives, monoclonal, fertility hormones, antitoxins, antifungals, anaesthetics, cardiovascular drugs, diagnostic products and more. The firm has a key manufacturing facility at Ambernath and another smaller facility at Thane. It also has a horse farm in Hyderabad, an R&D unit at Navi Mumbai and four wholly-owned subsidiaries in the US, Germany, the Philippines and India.

Paytm Payments Bank clash with auditor over financial viability amid regulatory curbs: Report,"Paytm Payments Bank Ltd (PPBL) has run into a dispute with its auditor JC Bhalla & Co over the certification of its accounts for the fiscal year 2024, the Economic Times reported. Given the regulatory restrictions that have brought its business to a near standstill, the auditor has raised concerns about the bank's viability. These remarks are related to whether the company remains a 'going concern' or not, according to sources familiar with the matter. PPBL has strongly opposed the auditor's suggested qualifications, arguing that the Paytm brand’s strength will support a revival plan and that there will be an infusion of capital to facilitate this. PPBL, which is 49 percent owned by listed One97 Communications and 51 percent held by founder-promoter Vijay Shekhar Sharma, is concerned that such qualifications could hinder its plan to obtain a payment aggregator licence for Paytm Payments Services Ltd. Sources close to the development indicated that efforts are ongoing to persuade the auditors to accept a management representation or a legal opinion affirming the business's viability. Senior management of One97 Communications is seeking intervention from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). However, it is unlikely the central bank will step in until the annual report is filed, as the matter stands between the management and the auditor. Also read: Paytm shares under pressure, block trades for up to 1.1 percent of equity “The RBI has not indicated to PPBL that it would be allowed to resume operations, such as mobilising deposits and onboarding new customers, nor has it set conditions like completing KYC of accounts to restore permissions,” said one of the sources. “In fact, the opportunity to rectify compliance matters has passed, and now it is directed to wind down operations and transfer all businesses to One97 Communications.” The central bank banned PPBL from accepting new deposits starting March 15 due to the bank's failure to comply with know-your-customer (KYC) guidelines, which require face-to-face verification and the collection of officially valid documents. Since then, PPBL’s net worth has eroded, and it has generated no income, with no immediate prospects of recovery. Moneycontrol could not very this news independently.

Kotak Mahindra Bank issues clarification on public statements made by Hindenburg,"Kotak Mahindra Bank on July 2 said that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has issued a show cause notice dated June 26 to Hindenburg Research, Kingdon, persons related to them as well as K India Opportunities Fund Limited. SEBI's allegations relate to short selling of the stock of Adani Enterprises Ltd. prior to the publication of a report by Hindenburg on January 25, 2023, the lender said in a regulatory filing. The transactions in respect of which the above allegations are being made were made by the Fund on the advice, and for the benefit, of its investor Kingdon, the bank clarified. K- India Opportunities Fund (KIOF) and Kotak Mahindra International Ltd (KMIL) are clients of Kotak Group. Regarding the notice, Kotak Mahindra Bank issued a clarification saying that Kingdon never disclosed to KMIL that they had any relationship with Hindenburg nor that they were acting on the basis of any price sensitive information. ""We deny any allegation of being aware of such report or acting in collusion in any manner with Kingdon or Hindenburg,"" it added. Earlier today, Kotak Mahindra group said Hindenburg Research was never a client of Kotak group's K- India Opportunities Fund (KIOF) and Kotak Mahindra International Ltd (KMIL) and that the fund was unaware of the US short seller being a partner of any of its investors. Hindenburg had said that Kotak Mahindra Bank and brokerage firms founded by Uday Kotak, created and oversaw the offshore fund structure used by the investor partner of Hindenburg to short Adani stocks. The US-based short-seller questioned why Sebi failed to name Kotak bank in its observations. “While Sebi seemingly tied itself in knots to claim jurisdiction over us, its notice conspicuously failed to name the party that has an actual tie to India: Kotak Bank, one of India’s largest banks and brokerage firms founded by Uday Kotak, which created and oversaw the offshore fund structure used by our investor partner to bet against Adani. Instead, it simply named the K-India Opportunities Fund and masked the name 'Kotak' name with the acronym 'KMIL',” Hindenburg said in an update. Hindenburg alleged that Sebi’s omission of Kotak’s name may be meant to protect the businessman from scrutiny. ""Uday Kotak, founder of the bank, personally led SEBI’s 2017 Committee on Corporate Governance. We suspect SEBI’s lack of mention of Kotak, or any other Kotak board member may be meant to protect yet another powerful Indian businessman from the prospect of scrutiny, a role SEBI seems to embrace,"" Hindenburg said. Sebi show cause notice to Hindenburg Hindenburg Research received a show cause notice from market regulator SEBI regarding its Adani Report, the firm said in a blog post on July 2. The 46-page show cause notice was delivered on June 27, Hindenburg said. The blog post said that the firm was short on Adani shares 'through a deal with an investor partner who was indirectly short Adani derivatives through a non-Indian, offshore fund structure'. The post revealing Sebi notice reiterates its position that Hindenburg had adequately disclosed that it was short on Adani shares, 'so readers could weigh the potential for bias given that we stood to benefit from a decline in Adani shares.' Hindenburg allegations On January 24, 2023, Hindenburg Research published a report accusing Adani group companies of stock manipulation and accounting fraud, ahead of a proposed Rs 20,000 crore share sale by Adani Enterprises. The conglomerate termed the report as malicious and baseless. Meanwhile, India's Supreme Court ruled in January that the Adani Group won't face any further investigations beyond Sebi's current scrutiny, offering relief to the conglomerate. Sebi has been probing the Adani group for tax haven use and stock manipulation. The verdict suggested no heightened regulatory risk for Adani. The court also decided against altering disclosure rules for offshore funds, despite Hindenburg's claims.

Som Distilleries shares surge 4% after Madhya Pradesh HC stays licence suspension,"Shares of Som Distilleries and Breweries Limited surged more than 3 percent on July 2 after the company informed that the suspension of its licence was stayed by the Madhya Pradesh High Court on June 28. The stock of the company was trading 3.51 percent higher at Rs 118.52 on NSE at 15:16 pm. Following the stay order, the company said normal operations have resumed at the firm’s plant. On July 2, Reuters reported that child labourers aged between 13 and 17 were found working during an inspection of a plant by the Madhya Pradesh government. The child labourers were made to fill and pack liquor bottles and were forced to work long hours, the news agency reported. The report said that police are investigating the use of child labour at the distillery in Madhya Pradesh after the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) said last month it had found 58 children working illegally at the factory. The commission released photos of some with hands showing chemical burns and said some children were transported in school buses for factory work. The report, which is not public but was seen by Reuters, says children were working 11-hour shifts starting at 8 am. The Madhya Pradesh government temporarily suspended the Som distillery's manufacturing licences, but the company has challenged the decision, saying there has been no conclusive finding of wrongdoing. After Som's challenge, a local court put the state's decision on hold and said it would next hear the case later this month. Som and the Madhya Pradesh government did not respond to the news agency's requests for comment. In a submission to the state government on June 18, also seen by Reuters, Som had said some children would visit the company to deliver food and medicines to their parents, and no worker was younger than 21.

Nvidia set to face French antitrust charges: Report,"Nvidia is set to be charged by the French antitrust regulator for allegedly anti-competitive practices, people with direct knowledge of the matter said, making it the first enforcer to act against the computer chip maker. The French so-called statement of objections or charge sheet would follow dawn raids in the graphics cards sector in September last year, which sources said targeted Nvidia. The raids were the result of a broader inquiry into cloud computing. The world's largest maker of chips used both for artificial intelligence and for computer graphics has seen demand for its chips jump following the release of the generative AI application ChatGPT, triggering regulatory scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic. The French authority, which publishes some but not all its statements of objections to companies, and Nvidia declined comment. The company in a regulatory filing last year said regulators in the European Union, China and France had asked for information on its graphic cards. The European Commission is unlikely to expand its preliminary review for now, since the French authority is looking into Nvidia, other people with direct knowledge of the matter said. The French watchdog in a report issued last Friday on competition in generative AI cited the risk of abuse by chip providers. It voiced concerns regarding the sector's dependence on Nvidia's CUDA chip programming software, the only system that is 100% compatible with the GPUs that have become essential for accelerated computing. It also cited unease about Nvidia’s recent investments in AI-focused cloud service providers such as CoreWeave. Companies risk fines of as much as 10% of their global annual turnover for breaching French antitrust rules, although they can also provide concessions to stave off penalties. The U.S. Department of Justice is taking the lead in investigating Nvidia as it divvies up Big Tech scrutiny with the Federal Trade Commission, a source familiar with the matter has told Reuters.

BlackRock enters booming market for stock ETFs with a 100% hedge,"BlackRock Inc. is the latest asset manager to launch an exchange-traded fund that offers a way to ride the stock rally — while hedging 100% of the downside if markets plunge. The iShares Large Cap Max Buffer Jun ETF is set to begin trading under the ticker MAXJ on Monday. Using options, it will provide investors with upside exposure to the S&P 500 to a cap of around 10.6% and hedge all of the downside over a 12-month period. Such offerings may appeal to investors looking to tap into stocks’ record-setting rally even as worries mount around the outlook for growth and earnings. At the same time the Federal Reserve is signaling plans to keep interest rates elevated, while the US presidential election adds another potential wild card for markets. As is typical for so-called buffer or defined-outcome ETFs, investors in MAXJ are only promised the full protection if they keep their money in the fund for its entire lifespan, which in this case is 12 months from the day it begins trading. Otherwise, they’ll have to jump into the fund when shares are near that starting level. A year from now, they can redeem their shares or roll them into the next cycle. “They really can almost be viewed as an alternative to cash or Treasury-like instruments in the sense that you’re getting that downside protection, while also the opportunity to capture market growth and upside,” Rachel Aguirre, head of US iShares product at BlackRock, said in an interview. BlackRock plans to issue the ETF in a series every three months, with the next one expected to debut on Oct. 1, followed by subsequent versions in January and April, it said in a press release. The cap will reset automatically at the end of each one-year period. Assets in buffer ETFs have grown to some $46 billion, roughly tripling since October 2022, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. While defensive-minded investors can get elevated risk-free payouts on Treasury bills, Aguirre said that these products would comfortably exceed those kind of returns in the event equities stage a fresh leg up. The S&P 500 gained around 14.5% in the first half of the year, buoyed by solid US growth and soaring megacap technology stocks. An ETF from Innovator ETFs that promises 100% protection against losses over a six-month period is also set to launch Monday. It will trade under the ticker JAJL.

Qualcomm sponsors Manchester United amid bigger consumer PC push,"Qualcomm Inc. has become the new front-of-shirt sponsor for Manchester United Football Club — an attempt to boost awareness of its Snapdragon brand among consumers amid a broader push into personal computing. The California-based chipmaker is paying for a prominent brand position with one of the best-known clubs in the world’s most popular sport. One home game for the UK Premier League team will give Snapdragon as much exposure as a Super Bowl ad, the company said. While Snapdragon has existed as a Qualcomm chip brand for almost two decades, mostly associated with smartphone processors, it’s now being tasked with playing a bigger role. Qualcomm is revving up its efforts to break into the PC industry, an attempt that will require it to take on one of the most successful marketing campaigns of all time: Intel Corp.’s ‘Intel Inside.’ Both Qualcomm and Manchester United declined to comment on the size of the sponsorship deal. Bloomberg reported last year that this partnership is valued at just over £60 million ($76 million) annually. That tops the roughly £47 million paid by the current kit sponsor, German software company TeamViewer SE, Bloomberg previously reported. The three-year agreement includes an option for two more, and gives the football club access to technology that it will use to create interactive bonus experiences for fans, according to Manchester United’s commercial director, Florence Lafaye. The US company has also improved the Wi-Fi service at the Old Trafford Stadium and will help provide an augmented reality “visit” to the football grounds, among other virtual experiences. The club has more than 1 billion followers worldwide, Lafaye said. Qualcomm’s sponsorship of the Manchester United shirt signifies its commitment to raising awareness of the Snapdragon brand, said Chief Marketing Officer Don McGuire. It’s part of a broader and sustained effort to help build the company’s position in PCs and other categories, he said. With greater backing from Microsoft Corp., Qualcomm is rekindling its effort to break into the PC market, which carries much higher average selling prices. It claims that machines powered by its chips will provide significantly longer battery life – days between recharges – along with access to artificial intelligence features being rolled out to this class of devices. Conveying those benefits to consumers who have likely owned phones using Qualcomm’s technology but don’t recognize it as a household name will be key for the company as it brings a more than decade-long effort to fruition. Despite an extended period without industry-leading products, Intel Corp. still has close to 80% market share in PC processors. Its underwriting of marketing for the PCs and the strength of its Intel Inside campaigns over the years have given it a strong grip on the industry. Qualcomm and other companies that have attempted to tailor smartphone-grade chips for laptops have failed to gain significant traction. McGuire, who formerly worked at Intel, says the Manchester United deal demonstrates that Qualcomm now understands that better products aren’t enough and that it will have to invest heavily if it wants to overturn Intel’s leadership in the laptop chip space. “Everyone’s completely in agreement that success is not defined by product alone,” he said. “We had to make up our minds that we’re committed to this business, not just to play, but win.” The launch of the new shirt will start with a video featuring former player Eric Cantona, and the two companies said they’re planning future roll-outs of technology-based offerings for fans. Manchester United will play three games in the US this summer, including one in San Diego, near Qualcomm’s headquarters.

NHRC says report on Foxconn hiring at Tamil Nadu plant raises discrimination concerns,"India's human rights watchdog said on Monday it had asked government officials to examine reported discrimination by Foxconn, after a Reuters investigation found the major Apple supplier has been rejecting married women from iPhone assembly jobs in the country. In a statement, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) said it had issued notices to the secretary of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's labour ministry and the chief secretary of the state government of Tamil Nadu, site of a major iPhone factory, calling for a detailed report within a week. ""NHRC observes that the matter, if true, raises a serious issue of discrimination against married women causing the violation of the right to equality and equal opportunity,"" it said. The Reuters story has sparked debates on TV channels, newspaper editorials, calls from women groups, including within Modi's party as well as opposition parties to investigate the matter. Modi's federal government has also asked Tamil Nadu state for a ""detailed report"". Modi's labour ministry, Apple and Taiwan-based Foxconn did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A Tamil Nadu government spokesman referred questions to its labour department, which did not respond. The Reuters investigation found Foxconn systematically excluded married women from jobs at its main India iPhone plant on the grounds they have more family responsibilities than their unmarried counterparts. Foxconn hiring agents and HR sources cited family duties, pregnancy and higher absenteeism as reasons for not hiring married women. Responding to the investigation, published last week, Apple and Foxconn acknowledged lapses in hiring practices in 2022 and said they had worked to address the issues. All the discriminatory practices documented by Reuters at the Tamil Nadu plant, however, took place in 2023 and 2024. The companies didn't address those instances. Foxconn has said it ""vigorously refutes allegations of employment discrimination based on marital status, gender, religion or any other form."" Apple has said all its suppliers, including Foxconn, hire married women and ""when concerns about hiring practices were first raised in 2022 we immediately took action and worked with our supplier to conduct monthly audits to identify issues and ensure that our high standards are upheld."" Indian law does not bar companies from discriminating in hiring based on marital status, though Apple's and Foxconn's policies prohibit such practices in their supply chains. The NHRC said it ""noted the fact that gender equality is not only required in the Indian constitution but the international treaty and covenants."" State authorities must ensure that all companies follow the norms and regulations relating to labour laws, it added.

Currently, Zaynich (Zidebactam/Cefepime- WCK 5222) is undergoing a multinational phase 3 study, which is expected to be completed by FY25, facilitating its global registration and marketing authorization, the company said.

Liquor firm Som Distilleries challenges license suspension in child labour case,"Indian liquor company Som Group has asked a state court to quash a government decision to temporarily suspend manufacturing licenses of one of its distilleries where a federal agency found 59 children working illegally, a court filing showed. Police, who have been investigating the Som distillery in Raisen district in the central state of Madhya Pradesh, locked its premises after the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights this month found 39 boys and 20 girls working at the factory. The agency also released photos of children's hands it said showed burns due to contact with chemicals, and said some of the children were transported to the factory in school buses. In a 169-page court filing in the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Som argued the licenses were wrongly suspended as the investigation into the allegations of child labour were still ongoing. ""There is no conclusion to the effect as to whether in reality any child was employed or not,"" Som Distilleries Pvt Ltd said in a court filing, which is not public but was reviewed by Reuters. Som did not respond to a request for comment, and neither did the Madhya Pradesh state government. The case was heard on Thursday but no order was passed.

"25% of new hires at Tamil Nadu plant are married women, clarifies iPhone maker Foxconn","Apple'S iPhone maker Foxconn on June 27 informed the Central government that around 25 percent its new employees are married women and its safety protocol, which requires everyone to avoid wearing metal irrespective of gender or religion, is not discriminatory, sources familiar with the matter said. The Taiwanese company shared an informal note with the government after reports suggested it is not hiring married women. The company said that such stipulations are not part of its policy and these claims may have been made by those disgruntled individuals who were not hired, sources said. They added that such media reports malign the fast-growing Indian manufacturing sector. Meanwhile, the ministry of labour and employment on June 26 had sought a detailed report from the Tamil Nadu labour department on the issue of married women not being allowed to work at the Foxconn India Apple iPhone Plant, as reported by the media. ""Foxconn had clarified that 25 percent of the latest hires are married women. This would mean nearly one-third of the total women are married. This ratio compares favourably to any factory in this sector currently operating in India,"" one of the sources said. The Foxconn factory currently has about 70 percent women and 30 percent men and the Tamil Nadu plant is the largest factory for women employment in the country with the total employment having touched 45,000 workers during peak periods, they said. The company has also informed that the discussion around Hindu married women being discriminated against for wearing metals (ornaments and jewelry) is ""entirely slanted"" and wearing metal in such factories is a safety issue, a fact well recognised by both the industry and the government. ""Any person wearing metals - man or woman - regardless of their status (single or married) and their religion (Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh etc.) are required to remove metals while working in the factory,"" the source said quoting the company's informal note. For safety reasons, no one wearing metal is allowed to work on the shop floor and this is a prevalent practice in several industries. According to sources, the company has stated that the media report is based on anecdotal comments by 5-10 people or potential job seekers. These comments likely came from candidates who did not get the job or no longer work at Foxconn. No immediate comments were received from Foxconn in response to an email query sent to the company on the matter. (With agency inputs) ",Foxconn,Technology Hardware & Electronics Manufacturing,0

'Expected IPO timelines are 18-24 months': Kogta Financial's Arun Kogta post fresh fund raise by Ontario Teachers,"Kogta Financial, an NBFC (non-banking financial services company), has sealed a series E fund raising round and mopped up Rs 1,230 crore from top Canadian pension fund Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan (OTPP), the lKogta Finanatest addition to its cap table. The deal has provided a partial exit to Creador and Morgan Stanley Private Equity Asia, even as the firm which is also backed by the likes of Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and Multiples Private Equity, looks to ramp up its presence in new geographies. The Jaipur-based NBFC was founded in 1996 and has assets under management of Rs 4,800 crore. Monyeycontrol's Ashwin Mohan caught up for a quick chat with Arun Kogta, MD & CEO of Kogta Financial on the deal rationale & valuations as well as the firm's listing plans in a busy market for equity capital market transactions. Edited excerpts: This is your fifth round of equity investment following the last one in March 2022. What made you pick OTPP, which will pick up a chunky minority stake. It also becomes the second Canadian pension fund to join the firm's cap table following peer CPPIB. We are delighted to have gained the trust of two pension funds investing in our company. This underscores our strong culture, governance standards, and growth prospects. Ontario Teachers' commitment is a significant addition to our investor base, bringing global experience, long-term capital, and a visionary outlook that aligns perfectly with our company's goals. Following the partial exits by existing investors Creador and Morgan Stanley PE and the entry of OTPP, how much stake do the founders own in Kogta Financial? The founders remain the single largest group of shareholders in the company, holding more than 30 percent on a fully diluted basis, and continue to retain operational control of the business. As an NBFC, you focus on the segments of vehicle finance and MSME loans. What are the new product offerings you will explore post the latest fund raise and any new cities or states you plan to cover? We will maintain our focus on vehicle finance and MSME loans, continuing to expand within our current geographies while initiating expansion into new states such as Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh starting in the second half of the year. At what valuation has the current deal been struck? We understand from our sources that OTPP will pick up around 24 percent stake in Kogta Financial for around $150 million, which would imply a valuation of roughly around $600 million. Is that range accurate? Yes, it is a fair range. With such a diversified cap table of leading investors, would you explore a potential IPO in the next 12-15 months? If yes, is a sixth fund raise on the cards before the listing? The expected IPO timelines are 18-24 months, but we can accelerate (our plans) if the markets are favourable. Do you expect M&A and IPO action to continue in the NBFC space? What deal trends are you seeing? Yes, we believe there is robust demand for companies that exhibit strong governance, a solid tech focus, and effective customer engagement. NBFCs demonstrating sustainable growth, consistent profitability, and high-quality portfolios are expected to attract significant investor interest. The segment shows strong growth momentum, which we anticipate will continue over the next 3-5 years.

Policyholders 'satisfied' as 94% health insurance claims get approved: Study,"At least 94 percent health insurance claims are now being approved, according to a study released by Policybazaar, ahead of the Insurance Awareness Day. The approval ratings went up to 97 percent for claims initiated through online channels, according to the report. However, the 6 percent claims that were rejected were attributed to non-disclosure of pre-existing or uncovered diseases, the report said. “This brings out the need for increased awareness and transparency in the industry along with product simplification so that there’s a better understanding between the consumer and the industry,” it said. The study also added that the involvement of both online and offline intermediaries can help turn over the tide and boost approval rates. The report has a sample size of 2,100 across 39 cities and provides a deeply researched narrative of the health insurance claims index in India. While 86 percent of the people studied said they were ‘satisfied’ with their claims experience, 40 percent said they were 'extremely satisfied'. The biggest reasons for such high positive feedback were cashless claims, online channels and minimal paperwork, the report found. The report also revealed that cashless claims offer a seamless experience with lower rejection rates. Reimbursement claims are sought only in cases where the preferred healthcare service provider is not in the network of the insurance company. “However, upfront payment for treatment remains a challenge for many, with approximately 70 percent of reimbursement claimants seeking financial aid through formal or informal loans or breaking their savings funds meant for other life goals,” it said.

"Gender minorities, marginalised groups to comprise 25% of Tata Steel workforce: Official","Tata Steel aims at having a minimum of 25 per cent of its workforce made up of diverse groups, including gender minorities, marginalised communities, persons with disabilities and LGBTQIA+ individuals, within the next few years, a company official said. It is one of the first companies in the country to roll out a special recruitment drive for transgender talent, having recruited over 100 members from the community for various roles across different locations, the official claimed. ""Continuing this drive, we aim to have 25 per cent of our workforce from diverse groups in the next couple of years,"" the official said. A total of 113 transgender individuals have been onboarded and posted at various locations, including manufacturing, operations and maintenance, mining, and services. These employees are stationed in Noamundi, West Bokaro, Kolkata, Kharagpur, Kalinganagar, and Jamshedpur. Some of these employees work all three shifts and operate Heavy Earth Moving Machinery (HEMM) at the Noamundi iron ore mine in Jharkhand's West Singhbhum and West Bokaro coal mine in Ramgarh district. ""Tata Steel appreciates the potential of diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) and has a tremendous organisational focus on it,"" the official said. ""In line with this, we renewed our commitment and refocused our approach to DE&I in 2015 by setting up MOSAIC - a platform for pioneering initiatives, diversity targets, and employee-friendly policies conceptualised and executed from the apex level,"" he added. The official admitted that the initial planning stage was challenging due to inadequate knowledge about the transgender community. ""However, we made a detailed plan and implemented it without any difficulty. To date, we have not received any complaint from either side of the employees since the first batch of transgender individuals was inducted following proper training in 2019,"" the official said.

India probe finds Byju’s didn’t commit fraud but had compliance lapses,"An India government investigation found lapses in the corporate governance of Byju’s, but cleared the struggling online-education startup of financial fraud. The yearlong probe by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs found no evidence of wrongdoing such as siphoning of funds or manipulation of financial accounts, people familiar with the matter said. Still, it discovered governance shortcomings that contributed to the startup’s mounting losses, the people said, asking not to be named as the investigators’ report isn’t public yet. The findings offer some support for once-celebrated founder Byju Raveendran, who’s been accused of mismanagement by disgruntled investors. Three shareholders including Prosus Ventures and Peak XV Partners, formerly Sequoia Capital India, left the board of Byju’s last year over differences with Raveendran on issues such as business processes and internal controls. The report also ends, at least temporarily, the possibility of any new scrutiny on the company by Indian officials on issues already probed. Representatives of the corporate affairs ministry, Byju’s, Peak XV and Prosus didn’t respond to requests for comment. The report doesn’t directly address whether Raveendran personally is at fault for the governance lapses or whether he is qualified to run the company. The disgruntled investors have sought his removal, citing management and compliance failures. The report also does little to stave off the company’s broader problems. The unprofitable startup’s quick expansion led to a cash crunch and a plunge in its valuation, and it’s now fighting multiple lawsuits in India and the US. The probe found that weak corporate governance and compliance practices, along with a change in the funding environment, contributed to its ballooning losses, the people said. Investigators also concluded that that startup failed to bring in professionals to oversee finances and compliance, which led to the losses, the people said. The report establishes that Byju’s didn’t disclose full details of acquisitions with all directors and that meetings to approve such deals were called at short notice. But it acknowledges the founders’ rationale that some directors were also investors at rival companies, according to the people. The ed-tech company was valued at $22 billion at its peak. Business surged during the two years of the Covid-19 pandemic but as infections subsided and classrooms resumed, its cash pile shrinked. It’s now battling several bankruptcy cases in India and overseas. Though Byju’s has managed to raise more than $100 million from existing investors through a fresh issuance of shares, an Indian court has barred it from using that money.

"Scorched in heatwaves, retailers defer end-of-season sales as shoppers stay indoors: Report","The end-of-season summer sales have been pushed by a week as brands grapple with excess inventories because of subdued demand in May, when heatwaves kept buyers away from the market, reported Business Standard. The absence of auspicious dates for marriage and Lok Sabha elections further contributed to the sluggish sales last month. Retailers noted that while April showed modest performance, the like-for-like growth turned negative in May. Like-for-like sales are used as an adjusted growth metric that includes revenues generated from stores or products with similar characteristics while omitting any the distinct differences that could skew the numbers. The mid-year end-of-season sales traditionally commence in mid-June and extend through July-end. Some items receive substantial markdowns approaching the Independence Day weekend. Despite increased inventories, discounts have remained unchanged. Manish Kapoor, chief executive officer (CEO), Pepe Jeans India, told Business Standard that demand has been slow in May and LFL growth was negative. Discounts offered by the denim brand this sales season were up to 50 percent and it intended to end sales by the third week of July, he added. A retailer said the inventory pileup for the industry was 20 percent higher than last year, the report said. Celio India has initiated its end-of-season sales four to five days ahead of schedule this year and will conclude them by the first week of August, it said. Satyen Momaya, CEO of Celio India, said that the festive season is arriving earlier than last year and they want to bring in fresh inventories before the season starts. According to the Retailers Association of India (RAI), retailers experienced a 3 percent growth, reported BS. “While consumer spending on non-essential items remains cautious, categories such as food, groceries, and consumer durables have shown a positive growth trajectory. Retailers are looking forward to the business post-election season.

Hyundai’s IPO can internationalise India’s capital market,"Hyundai’s proposed public issue, with the Korean parent offering for sale 17.5% stake in the Indian subsidiary, throws up some novel opportunities. The money raised would go out of India to the Korean parent, and so the effect would be no different from if the Korean parent were to raise fresh capital for itself in India, rather than in London or New York. Repatriation of the capital would take out a max of $3 billion from India, nothing to worry about, either in terms of the impact on India’s foreign exchange reserves or on the exchange rate. The potential benefits outweigh, by far, the potential harm. It Adds to Good Options of Domestic Investors The public issue would be a gain for the Indian investing public, who have been ratcheting up valuations in their investment universe of listed companies, comprising a limited number of investment-worthy companies, and of some dubious entities of the sort that simply insert AI in the company’s name and push WhatsApp messages to all and sundry expounding on the brave new world of artificial intelligence and the fortunes to be made by catching the wave early. Investors would get a chance to own a chunk of India’s second-largest car maker, with access to good research and development capabilities in its foreign parent. Elements of the Indian stock market ecosystem — merchant banks, brokerages, corporate law firms, rating agencies, sundry analysts, investment pools — all will get additional business. That is a transparent plus. Will There Be a Knock-On Effect? The interesting question is, will a successful Hyundai IPO induce other multinational companies to list their Indian arms, taking advantage of the Indian market's red-hot valuations? Will such capital raising add momentum to India’s capital account convertibility plans? Can India develop as a financial centre for companies from Asia and Africa, where the capital that is raised comes from foreign funds, as well as Indian investment pools, with India serving as a site for allocation of capital drawn from India and abroad? After all, this is what happens when a company offers shares and gets listed in London or New York. Getting a Leg Up on China India would, in the process, steal a march over China, whose own financial markets, including the market for equity capital, lag the country’s product markets in sophistication.The Chinese economy is right now struggling to recover from the collapse of its property sector. Real estate served as the principal form of savings for the Chinese, even after the homeownership rate rose to nearly 90% by 2014, many owning a second or even a third home. The illusion that residential property is a form of saving that would not lose value cannot sustain when excess supply finally meets with its reckoning, in the financial travails of property companies that cannot repay loans or complete projects that they have already sold. Right now, the Chinese are saving in tiny gold beads, after the collapse of the property market and of giant property firms like Evergrande.Chinese savings are still waiting to be financialised, which is why American financial majors do not join the chorus of decoupling from China. They see huge business potential in this area. READ | Everything you need to know about Hyundai Motor's mammoth IPO India’s financial markets are relatively more evolved, except for the market for corporate debt. In the speed of settlement of trades, in guaranteeing settlement, in applying price floors and ceilings in times of extreme stock price volatility, in the number of stocks with individual futures and options, and in the digital underpinning of capital market transactions, India is right there at the global cutting edge. Unlike in the US, where the regulation of financial and commodity markets, as well as of spot and forward markets, is split up among different regulators, India has unified regulation, with government debt being an outlier. Equities, a Preferred Choice Indian investors have been weaned off bank fixed deposits and a policy from the Life Insurance Corporation of India as their preferred forms of financial savings. Investment in stocks, via mutual funds, equity linked saving schemes and direct purchase, have grown by leaps and bounds, to a stage where the market can shrug off coordinated exits by foreign portfolio investors. Capital can flow in and out of India reasonably smoothly, and the International Financial Services Centre in GIFT City, Gujarat, makes the process even more frictionless. All this offers an opportunity for India to serve as a global centre of financial intermediation. Earlier, multinational companies listed their Indian arms out of regulatory compulsion. Now, Hyundai’s share price rise in Korea, after its IPO proposal in India came to light, makes it clear that India would be an attractive place for raising capital for global companies. Will this place an undue burden on India’s currency regime? That is unlikely, with foreign capital flowing in to take part in share offerings in India, along with participation by Indian investors. India’s capital account restrictions apply mostly to residents, not foreign investors. In the interest of extreme prudence, regulation can set limits on how much residents can invest in foreign share offerings. Right now, policy allows an individual resident to take out up to $250,000 for current or capital account purposes a year. The limit for an individual resident for participation in a foreign share offering in India could be fixed at, say, double that limit. While the resident would not be taking any capital out directly, her purchase of a foreign share offering would lead to an equivalent outflow by the issuing multinational. On the plus side, the additional demand for dollars in the forex market for repatriating IPO proceeds by MNCs would spare the RBI the need to purchase inflows to prevent overvaluation of the rupee. Once Hyundai tastes success, and other global companies with or without an Indian presence show an inclination to raise capital in India, the government should stand ready to welcome the move.

Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal moves HC seeking extension of interim medical bail,"Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal has moved the Bombay High Court seeking extension of the two-month interim medical bail granted to him earlier. On May 6, the high court had granted interim bail for two months on medical grounds to Goyal, arrested in a money laundering case by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Goyal, 75, has now filed an application seeking extension of the same. The plea said his medical condition continues to remain poor and that he has also lost his wife to cancer on May 16. The application came up for hearing on Tuesday before a single bench of Justice Manish Pitale. The court referred to a circular issued by the high court in February, stating that the applications where earlier pleas were considered and decided by a particular judge shall be placed before the same bench. Justice Pitale directed the high court's registry department to place Goyal's application before the single bench of Justice N J Jamadar, who had granted him interim bail in May for two months. Goyal's counsels Aabad Ponda and Ameet Naik said they would mention the plea before Justice Jamadar on Wednesday. Goyal was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in September 2023 on the allegations that he had laundered money and siphoned off loans to the tune of Rs 538.62 crore given to Jet Airways by Canara Bank. His wife, Anita Goyal was arrested in November 2023 when the ED submitted its chargesheet in the case. She was granted bail by the special court the same day considering her age and medical condition. She died on May 16.

CFO Jugeshinder Singh also said that Adani Enterprises will list its airport business in FY28, NDTV Profit reported. Singh said that its clean energy arm Adani Green will invest Rs 34,000 crore, the report said, adding 6-7 GW of capacity in the current financial year. Additionally, Singh said the margins currently stood at 30 percent following the deployment of all the capital. The CFO also highlighted that the group has the highest cash per share growth in the country at 43.2 percent, the news channel said. The group generates 70 percent of the cash required internally for every billion-dollar growth plan, Singh was quoted as saying in the report. Meanwhile, on June 25, Singh denied reports the group is planning to take a stake in payments firm Paytm, but said it will ""evaluate any opportunities"" in the fintech space, reported Reuters. The comments came a day after billionaire owner Gautam Adani told investors the group is ""well positioned"" to capitalise on opportunities in the country's booming infrastructure sector. The group, which has businesses across ports, power utilities, transmission and coal trading, is betting on infrastructure spending, which is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 20 percent-25 percent, Adani said on June 24. In January 2023, Hindenburg accused the Adani Group of improper use of tax havens and stock manipulation. The group, which refuted the allegations, sparked a $150-billion meltdown in market value as the short-seller's report roiled investor confidence and attracted regulatory scrutiny. Group companies, including Adani Power and Adani Ports , recouped all their losses and moved past pre-Hindenburg levels last year. Adani Enterprises, too, bounced back past those levels in May.

The company has invested Rs 100 crore to set up the washroom automation accessories production unit at Gurugram with an annual production capacity of 2 lakh units and it will become operational this month. ""In the last financial year we were around Rs 200 crore... This year we are looking at close to Rs 280 crore to Rs 290 crore and in FY25-26 we are chasing Rs 400 crore turnover,"" Euronics MD & CEO Viknesh Jain told PTI. He was responding to a query on the company's growth trajectory. Established in 2002, Euronics is a major player in India's public and commercial washroom sector, he said, with growth fuelled by the expansive growth of the country's public infrastructure, commercial real estate, and retail sectors. While initially it catered mainly to the private sector, including several Fortune 500 companies, Jain said in the past six to seven years it has started getting a lot of government projects. Euronics had recently undertaken washroom automation for Ram Mandir in Ayodhya; Yashobhoomi (India International Convention & Expo Center), New Parliament Building, airports across Ayodhya, Mumbai, Delhi, Goa, and Bangalore among other cities, and other smart city projects in India, Jain added. With the new plant coming in, the company said it will be able to fulfill 50 per cent of its average order volumes from the Gurugram unit alone. The unit will create around 200 blue-collar jobs. ""When we started it was more like contract manufacturing but right now around 50-60 per cent of the products which are sold by us are produced by us. The idea is to increase it to 80 per cent by the next year-end,"" Jain said. Currently, Euronics has other plants in Jamnagar, Greater Noida, and Bhiwadi. Bullish on India's public infrastructure sector, he said Euronics is set to meet its washroom automation needs with 100 per cent domestically manufactured accessories within the next three years.

Bobby Jain raises $5.3 billion in biggest hedge fund debut since 2018,"Bobby Jain has gathered $5.3 billion in commitments for his new multistrategy hedge fund, marking the biggest fundraising haul since ExodusPoint Capital Management’s record debut. Jain Global will start trading July 1, according to people familiar with the matter. Investors include endowments, foundations, family offices, bank wealth platforms and sovereign wealth funds. The premiere caps a busy year for Jain — former co-chief investment officer at Millennium Management — who has traveled the world pitching his fund. He initially aimed to gather as much as $10 billion. But after struggling to hit that goal, he cut client fees to entice investors and reduced his target to between $5 billion and $6 billion. A representative for the firm declined to comment. Even with the revised goal, Jain Global is the biggest launch since 2018. Jain topped fellow Millennium alumnus Diego Megia, whose Taula Capital Management began trading this month with $5 billion. Megia spun out his macro pod from Millennium and received $3 billion from his former employer. Jain has been raising money in a challenging environment, as interest rates remain elevated and deals have slowed to a trickle. New hedge funds also face stiff competition from bigger multistrategy funds with established track records. Despite those obstacles, Jain Global is starting off big — having hired 215 people, including 42 portfolio managers. The firm has seven businesses that will go live on July 1, including an Asia-Pacific business that will essentially act as a multimanager platform and trade six strategies, with the profits feeding into the Jain fund. The firm raised money via a so-called drawdown fund, meaning it will tap the cash as needed over a year. Michael Gelband’s ExodusPoint still enjoys the distinction of biggest-ever hedge fund debut. Yet another Millennium alumnus, Gelband raised $8 billion for a multistrategy fund that began in 2018 and has fixed-income and equity businesses. Jain launched his own shop after leaving Millennium, where he shared the CIO title with founder Izzy Englander. Over his seven years there, he helped the multistrategy giant push into new strategies, recruit, upgrade technologies and develop its central risk book. Millennium’s assets doubled to about $60 billion during his tenure. Prior to Millennium, Jain spent more than two decades at Credit Suisse Group AG, where he held many senior titles including head of global proprietary trading and global head of asset management.

Nvidia enters correction territory as slump erases $400 billion,"Nvidia Corp. shares fell on Monday, with the AI-focused chipmaker entering correction territory as it extends a sharp recent selloff. The stock fell 4.8% and is on track for its third straight negative session. It has dropped 12% over the three-day slide, putting it past the 10% threshold that represents a correction. The drop weighed on chipmakers with the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index falling as much as 2.2% on Monday. Broadcom Inc., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Qualcomm Inc. were all lower by at least 2%. The three-day drop erased more than $400 billion from Nvidia’s market capitalization, putting it back below the $3 trillion threshold, as well as below both Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. in size. Nvidia briefly claimed the title as the world’s largest stock last week. “In the near-term, it is plausible that investors begin suffering from AI-fatigue or become more broadly concerned about index concentration,” said Neville Javeri, portfolio manager and head of the Empiric LT Equity team at Allspring Global Investments. Even with the slump, Nvidia remains up more than 140% this year, making it the second-best performer among S&P 500 Index components, behind Super Micro Computer Inc., another favorite AI play. The stock suffered a drawdown of about 20% earlier this year, although it quickly returned to all-time highs. While investors have flocked to Nvidia given the sky-high demand for its chips used in AI processing, the scale of Nvidia’s rally — it also soared about 240% over the course of 2023 — has underlined concerns about its valuation. The stock trades at nearly 23 times estimated sales over the next 12 months, making it the most expensive in the S&P 500 by this measure. Still, it remains well liked on Wall Street. Nearly 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying, and the average analyst price target points to upside of about 10% from current levels. “The momentum in Nvidia and AI stocks in general has been staggering,” said Charlie Ashley, portfolio manager at Catalyst Funds. “In terms of investing, I would not be a contrarian right now.”

Passenger vehicle sales to see 3-5% growth this fiscal: Report,"Passenger vehicle sales is projected to grow at a moderate 3-5 per cent this financial year on account of a high-base effect of FY24, shrinking order book and subdued demand for entry-level variants, a report said on Monday. According to the report by credit ratings agency CareEdge, following robust growth of 90 per cent with volumes at 90,432 units in FY24, with an improving penetration rate, electric car sales in the passenger vehicle (PV) segment is likely to clock volume of around 1.30-1.50 lakh units in FY25. In FY22 and FY23, the PV industry experienced substantial year-on-year volume growth due to pent-up demand post-Covid recovery and new product introductions, it said. Utility vehicles played a significant role, with volumes increasing by 41 per cent in FY22 and 33.2 per cent in FY23. The industry benefitted from lower interest rates and an increased desire for personal mobility in the wake of the pandemic, CareEdge said. According to CareEdge, utility vehicles contributed 10-15 per cent of total passenger vehicle sales until FY12. It grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.51 per cent between FY13 and FY24, as consumer preference shifted towards utility vehicles that offered better and innovative designs, new models, technological, functional and safety features. For the past decade, the utility vehicles segment has consistently outperformed the passenger vehicle industry growth rate. In FY24, for the first time utility vehicles sales volume stood higher than passenger cars and vans, it said. Currently, utility vehicles account for over 55 per cent of all new PV sales and its share in overall passenger vehicle (PV) sales is expected to further rise over the medium-term, CareEdge said. ""The PV industry is expected to exhibit moderate volume growth of around 3-5 per cent in FY25 on account of a high-base effect of FY24, shrinking orderbook and expectation of persistently subdued demand for entry-level variants in FY25,"" said Arti Roy, Associate Director at CareEdge Ratings. Strong demand for new model launches and SUVs coupled with the expectation of interest rate cuts in the second half of FY25 is expected to keep the sales momentum rolling, she added. However, in line with CareEdge Ratings' expectation of volume growth of around 7-9 per cent in FY24, the PV industry volumes grew by 7.4 per cent in FY24, the ratings said. This moderation in year-on-year volume growth in FY24 was due to the levelling off of pent-up demand amid a hike in vehicle prices, high base effect of FY23 and the high-interest rate environment, it said. Strong order book in FY24, robust demand for new model launches and increasing demand in the sports utility vehicle (SUV) segment kept the sales momentum rolling, as per the report. ""While the market for premium vehicles is predicted to thrive, driven by a surge in demand for luxury and high-end models, entry-level variants are likely to see continued diminished demand due to a downturn in both rural and urban markets,"" said Hardik Shah, Director at CareEdge Ratings. The rural sector is feeling the pinch as entry-level vehicles are becoming more expensive, whereas urban consumers are increasingly opting for SUVs, reflecting a shift in market preferences, Shah added.

Musashi India begins mass production of e-Axles for EV two-wheelers,"Musashi Auto Parts India, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Japanese firm Musashi Seimitsu Industries, on Monday said it has started the mass production of e-Axles for electric two-wheelers in the domestic market. The company said it plans to invest a total of Rs 160 crore in its EV business in phase I. This significant investment will be used to establish new assembly lines for EV transmission components and upgrade existing facilities. The company entered the EV segment in India in September last year through a joint venture (JV) with Delta Electronics, Inc. and Toyota Tsusho Corporation to establish Musashi Delta e-Axle India Private Limited. The company further said it has established a capacity to produce 10,000 e-Axles per month in phase 1, with plans to ramp up production with additional lines from the third year onwards. ""With the rapid growth of EV two-wheelers in India, the need to build a local and robust ecosystem of EV components is imperative,"" said Naoya Nishimura (CEO India & Africa Region). Musashi said it plans to achieve a localisation level of two-thirds of the total cost by the end of this financial year, with a motor assembly line and a drive unit assembly line. It is also working with BNC Motors to develop products equipped with EV drive units. These units will be used in BNC's upcoming EV two-wheeler that will be equivalent to a 125cc ICE scooter.

Vedanta mulls first dollar bond sale of $500 million,"The Indian mining company controlled by billionaire Anil Agarwal is considering tapping bond markets for at least $500 million in a debut overseas issuance, according to two people familiar with the proposal. Vedanta Ltd. is discussing the plan with lenders and seeking legal opinions about the potential sale, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing non-public issues. The bond sale could climb to $1 billion depending on the response from investors, according to one of the people. The company is also exploring other avenues of fundraising, including equity sales and local currency loans from domestic banks, the people said. Officials at Vedanta didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The move comes at a time when four high-yield dollar bonds sold by Vedanta’s parent company, Vedanta Resources Ltd., are the top performers from India so far this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The holding company earlier this year successfully restructured its offshore bonds. Vedanta Ltd. has historically sold local currency bonds and borrowed in rupees from local lenders. Last week, the company’s board approved the sale of 10 billion rupees ($120 million) in local, non-convertible debentures. Vedanta has interests in semiconductors and commodities including aluminum, oil and gas, iron and copper. While largely concentrated in India, it has operations in South Africa, Namibia and Liberia as well. The 2024-25 fiscal year is lining up to be a critical one for Vedanta, Executive Director Arun Misra said during an analysts’ call on April 25, when he discussed plans for $1.9 billion in capex spending. The dollar bond sale would provide revenue for that expansion. In an overhaul announced last year, Agarwal is working to divide the company into six different business units: Vedanta Ltd. would control the semiconductor, zinc and stainless steel business. The company said the split would be completed in the fiscal year ending in March 2025.

"Kotak Mahindra Bank to add up to 200 branches in FY25, official says","Kotak Mahindra Bank will increase its pace of opening new branches and add about 175 to 200 branches in the financial year 2024-25, a senior official at the bank said, months after the central bank barred the private lender from sourcing new customers digitally. In April, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) stopped Kotak from adding new customers via its online and mobile banking channels, and from issuing new credit cards, due to information technology-related deficiencies. ""We have been adding roughly 150 odd branches for several years now. This year too, the momentum is going to continue,"" Virat Diwanji, group president and head - consumer bank, told Reuters in an email interview on Monday. India's fourth-largest private lender will target the pockets where there is easy availability of deposits, the official said, adding that customer acquisition through branches is seeing good traction. Before the RBI's order, Kotak was heavily reliant on digital channels to source new clients. About 95% of its new personal loans by volume were disbursed digitally in the October-December quarter, while it issued 99% of new credit cards through digital channels. A similar breakup for the January-March quarter is not yet available. Kotak's branch addition plans may not immediately help source new customers, but the strategy may play out in the medium-to-longer term as it will increase its presence and reach, said Kranthi Baithini, director of equity strategy at WealthMills Securities. However, that will come with high overhead costs, he said. Meanwhile, the bank is working ""steadfastly"" to fulfill the RBI's requirements and return to business as usual, Diwanji said. The private lender has stepped up investments to fortify its IT systems, including steps to strengthen its digital payment security controls and meet regulatory data cybersecurity standards, he added. Kotak has hired over 530 employees in the last 12-15 months, a majority of them from tech backgrounds, he said. The bank's focus on personal loans and business loans will continue, Diwanji said.

The strike action, described by Unite as the first strikes by British steel workers in 40 years, will take place at Tata's Port Talbot and Llanwern sites in Wales. The closures were announced in January as part of the Indian company's plan to turn around its loss-making UK business by switching to lower carbon electric arc furnaces, a proposal backed by 500 million pounds ($632 million) of government money. ""Tata’s workers are not just fighting for their jobs - they are fighting for the future of their communities and the future of steel in Wales,"" Unite General Secretary Sharon Graham said. Tata Steel employs more than 8,000 people in the UK. The company said in January about about 2,500 jobs of the total being cut were likely to go over the next 18 months. Reacting to the strike decision by the union, a Tata Steel spokesperson said: ""We are extremely disappointed by Unite’s unilateral decision to call strike action. Our existing steelmaking assets are near the end of their life, are operationally unstable and causing unsustainable losses of £1 million a day. This is why preparations to close the blast furnaces and associated plants in Port Talbot are unchanged."" “However, if the safety and stability of our operations are put at risk by this action, we will be forced to accelerate those closure plans.

Steelmaker Arcelor-Nippon says India's plan for raw material curbs ignores Red Sea crisis,"ArcelorMittal's India joint venture has privately warned trade officials in New Delhi that a plan to curb imports of a key raw material for steelmaking overlooks the implications of the Red Sea crisis, a letter showed. The curbs planned by the world's second-biggest producer of crude steel could hit output, as they cap imports of a steelmaking fuel, low ash metallurgical coke, also known as met coke, at 2.85 million metric tons for a year. The April proposal, which came after growing shipments caused ""serious injury"" to domestic producers, also recommended setting quotas on met coke for exporting nations. ""India should not close its eyes to the geopolitical situation and implement a measure that may adversely affect its steel industry,"" the company told the directorate general of trade remedies (DGTR) in the June 3 letter, seen by Reuters. Quotas envisioned for European countries under the plan ""will very seriously affect"" imports from the region, it added. The company, India's commerce ministry and the trade remedies body did not respond to requests for comment. No date has yet been set for the proposal, now being reviewed by the commerce ministry, to take effect. India's plan to allot about 40% import quota to European nations will affect ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India (AM/NS India) as the Red Sea crisis has already forced rerouting of vessels, and boosted ocean shipping rates, the company said. The company does not use domestic met coke. India's imports oMost Usedf the fuel have more than doubled over the past four years, and its top suppliers include Poland and Switzerland, as well as China and Indonesia. Attacks on ships in the Red Sea by Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi militants are disrupting trade, with freight firms switching to routes around the Cape of Good Hope to avoid the Suez Canal. India must reconsider the proposal as it could hit the steel industry, the company, which has not commented on the matter publicly, urged in its letter. This month, Reuters reported that India's steel ministry also did not favour limits on imports of met coke, citing risks to domestic output. In its letter, AM/NS India said authorities proposing the curbs did not factor in the prospect of increased demand for met coke as steelmakers plan to add capacity. ""The quantiative restraint on imports will reduce the ability for the steel industry to raise its capacity and growth levels,"" it added. One of India's leading steelmakers, with annual capacity of about 9 million metric tons, AM/NS India competes with JSW Steel Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd.

More than 50% Indian households downing soft drinks; to increase with intensifying heat: Report,"The average Indian household's consumption of bottled soft drinks has increased in the last two years, breaching annual penetration of 50 per cent in FY24, a report said. According to the latest Kantar FMCG pulse report, this trend is expected to rise further with intensifying summer. It said the average household has expanded its consumption of bottled soft drinks by 250 ml in the last two years. Moreover, fabric softeners, still considered to be a premium laundry item, have now reached one in every four households in the country, the report said. Besides, washing liquids, another premium laundry product introduced by leading FMCG majors, breached the 100,000-tonne mark in FY24. All these trends are ""record breakers"", the report noted. The bottled soft drink category had a ""massive 41 per cent household growth in MAT (moving annual total) March 2023"" and continued to add more households and expanded 19 per cent in MAT March 2024. ""With the intensifying summer, the category is likely to continue its growth this year too,"" it said. On the consumption, the report said now consumers shop FMCG products 156 times a year, or every 56 hours from online or offline channels. However, it also added that the average basket value has gone down as shoppers are no longer buying more packs as they were purchasing earlier. ""The frequency and the pack trends indicate that shoppers are no longer reducing their pack sizes, but holding on to the ones they are buying. In other words, we are very likely at the juncture where we see shoppers buying slightly bigger packs from now on,"" it said. Now discretionary premium-end categories like washing liquids and indulgent products such as bottled soft drinks have performed exceedingly well. Still, groceries are the biggest household expense, accounting for over 24 per cent of all quarterly expenses in a household, it added. The report also highlighted that though inflation might have slowed to acceptable levels, its effects are not lost on the consumer. ""The worst of inflation is behind us, however, there are pockets of the market that are still under some stress...the shopper is looking at the future with great optimism, even those who are under stress, and this optimism has been the flag bearer of the Indian consumption story for long now,"" it said.

Then in November, Aster DM Healthcare approved the sale of its Middle East or GCC (Gulf Co-Operation Council) business to Alpha GCC Holdings Ltd for an equity value of a billion dollars. The promoter family currently holds 41.88 per cent stake in Aster DM Healthcare. Post the announcement of the GCC deal, when asked if the firm would be open to sell a majority stake in the India business as well, Dr Azad Moopen, Chairman, Aster DM Healthcare said, "" If it's a very good partner who comes in and we have the strategic benefit of having a team and we have the knowledge, then we are okay to go with not a majority stake, but we can go with a joint control and things like that.

The Burmans, who founded and control consumer goods conglomerate Dabur India, raised its stake in Religare to nearly 25% in September last year, triggering the so-called open offer requirement that allows them to buy more shares from public shareholders. However, Religare had sought to block the deal saying the open offer was ""riddled with irregularities and statutory violations and cast serious doubts on the fit and proper status of the acquirers."" The Burmans -- who want to buy around 26% more of Religare to bolster its presence in the rapidly growing financial services sector -- approached the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) due to the company's lack of cooperation. The SEBI, in an interim order dated June 19, asked Religare to furnish an undertaking that it will apply by July 12 to regulatory authorities, including the central bank, for approvals for the open offer. It also asked Religare to form a committee of independent directors, if not already done, but did not give a reason for the directive.

India set for decade-high $2 billion bond inflows around JPMorgan index inclusion day,"Foreign inflows into Indian bonds will hit a decade-high of $2 billion around June 28, when they will be included in a widely-tracked JPMorgan index, although the central bank will lap up most of the dollars to avoid a knee-jerk rise in the rupee, bankers said. The $2 billion, single-day inflow estimate by four bankers trails only the record-high $2.7 billion poured into Indian bonds on Aug. 20, 2014, as prospects of a credit rating upgrade gained traction. More than $200 billion in assets track the JPMorgan Emerging Market Index in which India will eventually have a weight of 10% by March 2025, suggesting total passive inflows of at least $20 billion over the 10-month period. The Reserve Bank of India, which has been keeping a hawk eye on the rupee to prevent it from plumbing lifetime lows, will be vigilant of the inflows and speculative positioning on the currency, but has not adopted additional surveillance measures, a source aware of the RBI's plans said. ""It's just a case of inflows, this time in debt instead of equities,"" the source said. ""It might be positive for the rupee and might be positive for FX reserves as well."" The source and the bankers requested anonymity as they are not authorised to speak to the media. The RBI did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Since the rupee's real effective exchange rate -- a gauge of its relative value against a basket of currencies -- is signaling it is moderately over-valued, the RBI is wary of any significant appreciation, the source said. So, while front-running in anticipation of the inflows may boost the rupee, a large rally is unlikely given the central bank's grip on the currency, the bankers said. The RBI has said it will continue to boost its forex reserves opportunistically, which, in turn, helps avoid a sudden surge in the rupee. Since there is no precedent for these debt index-related inflows, bankers' estimates of the timing of flows are based on similar index adjustments in the equity markets. ""Obviously, all this is a first and you can't be sure how things will be,"" the head of trading at a large foreign bank cautioned. ""However, based on how portfolio flows related to (equity) rebalancing happen, the money will come in on (June) 27 or 28."" In anticipation, large foreign banks could look at building short dollar/rupee positions to help manage inflows when they happen, an FX trader at a foreign bank said. Still, despite the best-laid plans, concerns persist. As a senior banker at a large foreign bank said: ""all the pipes that have been put in place might not work.""

Indian automobile industry grows 19% to Rs 10.22 lakh crore in FY24: Report,"The Indian automobile industry grew 19 per cent to Rs 10.22 lakh crore in FY24 driven by a robust growth in the utility and sports utility vehicle (SUV) segment, a report said on Wednesday.

A notable shift in the UV and SUV segment was that the volume increased by 23 per cent and price by 16 per cent leading to overall value increase by 39 per cent last fiscal year. The average price increase in this segment was due to general rise in prices, shift to higher segment, shift to hybrid and automatic, popularity of sunroof and shift to electric vehicles (EVs), it said. Indians are preferring higher, more expensive models across segments, and the average price of vehicles is increasing, as per the report. ""India is at the forefront in leading the global automobile race, bypassing lower-priced products and creating more value in feature-rich, higher-priced vehicles. Consumer preferences and robust economic fundamentals are drivers of this transformation in the Indian automobile industry. Significantly, the UV and SUV segments are becoming a preferred choice for most Indian consumers,"" said Anurag Singh, Managing Director of Primus Partners. On the other hand, the passenger vehicle (PV) segment saw a decline of 9 per cent in volume due to a slight price increase, resulting in 4 per cent value drop. In the two-wheeler segment, India witnessed 10 per cent increase in volume and 13 per cent in value. The three-wheeler segment grew by 16 per cent in volume and 24 per cent in value and the commercial vehicle segment rose by 3 per cent in volume and 7 per cent in value. The report noted that while India is at number three in terms of vehicles registered behind China and the US, in value terms it is behind countries like Japan and Germany. Besides, the average price of a vehicle in India is lower than that of many advanced countries. The value of the Indian Automobile industry is growing at a faster rate than volume. Also, according to the report, India is the number one producer of two-wheelers with more than 20 million units produced last year. The two-wheeler segment dominates in volume with 76 per cent share, while value share is 18 per cent. As per the report, 2023-24 proved to be a strong year for the global automobile industry. The lingering pent-up demand from the pandemic period remained active while many of the supply chain constraints had eased up.

Adani Group to invest $100 billion in energy transition: Gautam Adani,"Adani group will invest more than USD 100 billion (around Rs 835 crore) in energy transition projects and manufacturing capability to produce every major component required for green energy generation, its chairman said on Wednesday. Besides building solar parks to produce electricity from sunlight and wind farms that do the same from wind, the conglomerate is building major facilities to manufacture electrolyzers for making green hydrogen, wind power turbines and solar panels. Green hydrogen, which is made by splitting hydrogen from water with the help of electrolyzers powered by clean energy, is seen as a potential panacea for decarbonizing the industry as well as transportation. Speaking at 'Infrastructure - the Catalyst for India's Future' event of Crisil, Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani said energy transition and digital infrastructure are trillion-dollar opportunities which will transform India both at a local and at a global scale. ""The next decade will see us invest more than USD 100 billion in the energy transition space and further expand our integrated renewable energy value chain that today already spans the manufacturing of every major component required for green energy generation,"" he said. The coal-to-ports group wants to produce the ""world's least expensive green electron"" that will become the feedstock for several sectors that must meet the sustainability mandate. ""And to make this happen, we are already building the world's largest single-site renewable energy park in Khavda, in the district of Kutch (in Gujarat). Just this single location will generate 30 GW of power, thereby taking our total renewable energy capacity to 50 GW by 2030,"" he said. Adani said the energy transition space will fundamentally change the global energy landscape forever. ""The global transition market was valued at approximately USD 3 trillion in 2023 and is expected to grow to nearly USD 6 trillion by 2030, and thereafter double every 10 years till 2050."" ""As many of you know, in the case of India, our country aims to install 500 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2030. This ambitious target will require annual investments of over USD 150 billion dollars. The transition to green energy in India is expected to generate millions of new jobs in sectors such as solar and wind, energy storage, hydrogen and its derivatives, EV charging stations, as well as grid infrastructure development,"" he said. On digital infrastructure, he said data is indeed the new oil and at the heart of all the action is the Data Centre - the critical infrastructure needed to power all forms of computational needs, especially AI workloads for machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, computer vision, and deep learning. All of this is dependent on the ability to process data at an unprecedented speed and scale which are the precise capabilities that data centres provide. However, this will need massive amounts of energy, making the data centre business the largest energy consuming industry in the world, he said. ""This makes the energy transition even more complex and is raising electricity prices, thereby adding to the already high prices because of the combined impact of climate change and demand growth,"" Adani said. The billionaire said the infrastructure required for energy transition and the infrastructure required for digital transformation are now inseparable as the technology sector becomes the largest consumer of the precious green electrons. Adani group's digital footprint will span industrial clouds across each of its businesses that it will productize and then take to market, operational technology cybersecurity offerings, super apps to leverage its B2C businesses across wide variety of consumer facing businesses, Artificial Intelligence labs to capitalize on India's fast emerging expertise to provide AI services to the world, and Data Centres that will form the backbone of the energy intensive digital revolution. ""In fact, it is anticipated that by the year 2030, the world will need 100 to 150 GW of additional green energy just for the AI data centres. We already have India's largest order book for data centres and are now in discussions for additional gigawatt-scale green AI data centres which we are uniquely positioned to deliver,"" he said.

The channel also reported that the disinvestment plans have been postponed as of now and it is unlikely that the sale will materialise this year. The strategic sale of government’s 30.8 percent stake out of 54.8 percent in the Rs 68,230-crore company was approved in 2019, which also included the transfer management control. Since then, the plan has hit several roadblocks. JSW, Maersk and Adani were interested in acquiring Centre’s stake, however, the railway ministry has some concerns about getting in a strategic investor, according to reports. Last year, Moneycontrol had also reported that the disinvestment of Concor was not moving ahead because of concerns raised by its parent organisation. “Regarding the strategic sale of CONCOR, the railways has raised some direct concerns. NITI Aayog is on board for the divestment of CONCOR but the railways is not keen to sell the asset. There are many things to be done before it can happen. Currently, it is at status quo,” a senior official had told Moneycontrol. As of last year, the company runs 61 inland container depots, of which 26 are on land leased from Indian Railways.

"Embraer sees India, Saudi Arabia, EU, US as strategic defense markets","Brazilian planemaker Embraer sees India, Saudi Arabia, the European Union and the United States as strategic markets for its defense unit as it looks to expand sales of the C-390 Millennium, the head of Embraer Defense said on Tuesday. India has an open tender to buy military planes while Saudi Arabia, looking to replace an aging fleet of Lockheed Martin's C-130 Hercules, is currently in ""early engagement"" with Embraer, Bosco da Costa Junior told reporters at an event. ""They don't have an open tender, but they need to replace their old C-130s. We did a lot of studies and concluded that the (Embraer) C-390 could deliver additional capability in this replacement process,"" Costa Junior said. A potential Saudi purchase could reach 25 units, and Embraer expects the country to make a decision in two to four years, the executive added. In addition to Embraer's home country Brazil, nations such as Portugal, Hungary, the Netherlands, Austria, the Czech Republic and South Korea have selected the planemaker's military transportation aircraft. Expanding its presence abroad with more C-390 sales has been a key goal of Embraer's defense division, which also sees Sweden as a potential customer. It has partnerships with Mahindra in India and Saab in Sweden to introduce the plane. Embraer has also been ""aggressive on several fronts"" in the United States, Costa Junior said, including exploring opportunities for mergers or acquisitions as well as pitching the C-390 to the U.S. Marines, Air Force and special forces. ""We do believe that the C-390 could add additional value to those entities in the U.S.,"" the executive said. ""One thing is clear to us: We would like to become a partner of the U.S. government."" Asked if any potential relationship with China could compromise connections with the U.S., Costa Junior stressed that Embraer's defense business had no relationship or any kind of discussions with the Asian superpower. ""We are 100% U.S.- and NATO-oriented,"" he said.

In confectionary, Nestle India said it sold 4,200 million fingers of KitKat. The growth was fuelled by the launch of new products, expansion of the distribution network and innovative brand activations.

In India, brand Maggi recovered after a five-month ban on its instant noodles over allegation of containing lead beyond permissible limits. However, the instant noodles returned to market after a relaunch in November 2015 and later Nestle India extended the brand in the food segment and adjacencies.

It is also expanding its presence and through RUrban journey its direct coverage has gone beyond two lakh villages. Nestle India recently announced to continue to pay royalty to its parent company at the existing rate of 4.5 per cent of net sales after a proposal to hike it was rejected by shareholders.

HSBC sees $250 million of India swap deals before JPM inclusion,"HSBC Holdings Plc has executed nearly half the volume of bond-derivative trades in India’s international finance hub over the last month, ahead of the sovereign bonds’ inclusion in a key global index. The British bank, via its unit in the International Financial Services Centres Authority, carried out the so-called total return swap deals worth more than $250 million with foreign investors who want onshore bond exposure, its head of India markets said. That compares with a total volume of about $510 million. The total-return swaps have emerged as one of the key products for foreigners to get India exposure without necessarily having to get a license to buy the bonds onshore and deal with local regulations. Foreign investors have been piling into Indian sovereign bonds ahead of their inclusion into JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s emerging-market index from June 28. HSBC has actively engaged with offshore investors to offer both direct access as well as total-return swaps for Indian government bonds, said Anita Mishra, head of markets and securities services at HSBC India. Standard Chartered Plc offers a similar derivative product. About three to four foreign banks have written the offshore derivatives so far, K. Rajaraman, chairman of the International Financial Services Centres Authority, said. “This year we are seeing a lot of traction, especially after the inclusion of India in the bond indices,” he said. About $10 billion of inflows have come into India’s index-eligible bonds since JPMorgan announced in September that it will include the nation’s bonds in its flagship index. Some funds are using other alternatives like investing in rupee-denominated supranational bonds or in an India bond exchange-traded fund like those offered by BlackRock Inc. or Legal & General Investment Management to get India exposure.

HUDCO raises $200 million from overseas lenders,"Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO) has raised USD 200 million (JPY 30 billion) in its maiden foray into the syndicated loan market, its arranger said on Tuesday.

The deal, led by SMBC's Singapore branch, saw an oversubscription with a total of nine lenders, and was upsized from its original launch size of JPY 15 billion to JPY 30 billion after exercising the greenshoe option, an official statement said.

""We look forward to expanding our reach to the underserved communities and strengthening the local community's access to resources,"" Hiroyuki Mesaki, country head of SMBC India, said. SMBC India's chief business officer Rakesh Garg said the financing sets new benchmarks and paves the way for more Indian companies to tap into the Japanese Yen loan markets. HUDCO's chairman and managing director Sanjay Kulshreshta said the body anticipates a surge in demand for its services given the government's focus on infrastructure-led growth. ""The substantial increase in infrastructure outlay signals significant growth prospects,"" he said, adding that the deal helps diversify the resource base and optimise costs.
