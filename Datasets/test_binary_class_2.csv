"Byju’s was the problem, not edtech","Following Byju’s fall from being India’s most valued Unicorn to being sued for insolvency, there is a growing perception that edtech, as a sector, should be shunned by capital and talent. This would be a mistake. One mismanaged company should not damn an entire sector. India needs technology to revamp its education sector and realise its demographic dividend. Online coaching for intensely competitive entrance examinations is but one area for the deployment of technology in the education sector. And it is the one service that is most is most likely to be at the receiving end of outrage and anger, if the stress produced by preparing for intensely competitive entrance examinations leads on to despair and self-harm, including of the terminal kind, by some exam takers. There is a case for vastly increasing the number of premier technical and medical educational institutions at the college level, and reducing the competition to get placed in a few elite institutions. A generalised increase in quality across-the-board is necessary to prevent wasting much adolescent passion and health in coaching and cramming to gain admission to an elite handful of institutions. China’s restrictive approach to coaching China put severe restrictions on supplementary coaching, in terms of how late into the evening it can rob students of rest, recreation and one another’s company, and of how much can be charged for coaching. Chinese restrictions went as far as to limit capital raising opportunities for companies in the edtech sector. This is extreme. India needs edtech, superior to Byju’s in terms of corporate governance and fiduciary responsibility, and in terms of the technology as well. The world has left behind it the reassuring era, in which what someone learned at school or college stood them in good stead for a lifelong career. Skilling never stops Today, skills that were unheard of in the past decade crop up and grow in importance over a short time horizon, and disappear into obsolescence, just as fast, as newer ones take over. People need to reskill and upgrade what they know all through their career, if some algorithm or robot is not to eat their respective jobs. And edtech would be the mainstay of constant skill upgradation and retraining. We need more, and constantly evolving edtech, to keep our talent always contemporary and flexible. Search for an online course to learn a little more on anything, whether wine, Shakespeare, probability or Natural Language Processing, you will find a massive open online course waiting for you, and offered by a university from the West. There is no reason to cede this space of supplementary education to foreign firms. Artificial Intelligence opens up the possibility of sharply reducing the cost of evaluating academic outcomes in such online courses. Indian companies must thrive in the space. For that, there must be startups, venture capital to fund them, and top-notch talent to staff them. Schools are more, not less important But for students to be able to take advantage of online courses, they should have learned to learn, during the course of their formal schooling at whatever level. If, instead, they merely learned some pre-defined stuff and even used coaching, online and offline, to that end, but did not learn the art of critical inquiry and constant expansion of their mental horizons, the best online courses for skill upgradation and further study would be of little avail. The education system, at large, fails India’s young in multiple ways. For one, it even fails to teach them enough of anything, in quantity or quality. This is why, year-after-year, surveys of education report high-school students who cannot read at Class 3 levels or divide a three-digit number by, say, 8. Students complete high school without learning anything much. Thanks to the vagaries of our education system, some of them go on to college and graduate, only to join the army of those dubbed unemployable. This is tragedy at the level of the individual and costly squandering of our potentially massive demographic dividend, at the level of the economy and the nation. Edtech can complement schools This should not be allowed to continue. Our schools must be rendered functional. And edtech can play a very useful role in that process. A primary use would be to measure individual progress in a large class of students with differing abilities and different levels of attained proficiency, with a view to identifying the laggards and assisting them to catch up. Students who move up through different levels of schooling, without having mastered what they are supposed to learn at the early levels, end up with low comprehension of what they are supposed to learn at higher levels, particularly in subjects like maths and science that build upon prior learning to develop an understanding of more advanced concepts. The only way for a country like India, with limited resources and an enormous student population, to make real progress in education is to deploy tech to assist teachers in continual monitoring of the scholastic achievement of individual members of their class, locate shortcomings and take steps to remedy them. That tech, which would replace once-a-year exams with continuous evaluation, needs to be developed, and that calls for attracting investment and talent. Edtech has not become redundant. Rather, it gains in salience with every step the world, and therefore, India, take towards and into the expanding knowledge economy. Let not our disappointment over one fallen star stop us from seeing all those points of light that point us to the future.

Telecom tower companies want Budget to extend input tax credit to infra,"Telecom tower and infrastructure companies want industrial electricity tariffs for telecommunication infrastructure across all states. They say the move could reduce operational costs by up to 20 percent, freeing up resources for network expansion. Their budget wishlist also includes Input Tax Credit for telecom towers under the GST regime. The change would significantly reduce costs for infrastructure providers and ultimately benefit consumers, the companies, through their representative body the Digital Infrastructure Providers Association (DIPA), has said. They have also sought clarity on the eligibility of related infrastructure and accessories for Input Tax Credit, saying the current ambiguity leads to substantial financial exposure. DIPA represents telecom towers and infrastructure companies such as Indus Towers, Ascend Telecom, Summit Digitel, iBUS Networks, Pratap Technocrats, Crest Digitel American Tower Corporation, and Suyog Telematics. ""We also advocate for the nationwide adoption of Green Energy Open Access policies, which would support both our sustainability goals and cost-efficiency efforts,"" said Tilak Raj Dua, Director General of the Digital Infrastructure Providers Association. The body reiterated its demand for recommendations of swift implementation of the amended Right of Way (RoW) rules across all states and union territories. Dua said standardisation was vital for streamlining infrastructure deployment and reducing bureaucratic hurdles. ""As we approach the upcoming budget, the Digital Infrastructure Providers Association (DIPA) urges the government to prioritise policies to accelerate the development of robust digital infrastructure across India. Our nation's digital future hinges on the rapid expansion of telecom networks, particularly 5G, and improved connectivity in rural areas,"" Dua said. The measures were critical to creating a conducive environment for digital infrastructure growth. The companies also sought clear guidelines on the definition of telecommunication networks, fair RoW grants and the separation of telecom infrastructure from property considerations under the Telecommunication Act, 2023. The government said it would notify all rules and provisions of the new Telecom Act within the next 180 days. In June, the government notified 39 provisions of the Telecommunications Act related to taking temporary possession of telecom networks in the interest of public safety or during emergencies, penalties on more than allowed SIM ownership, intercepting messages and right of way for telecom infrastructure. However, the more contentious rules on the administrative allocation of satellite spectrum, mandatory biometric verification of users by telecom companies and a smoother dispute resolution mechanism are yet to be notified. ""We notified the Act late last month, and I commit to you that within 180 days, which is our deadline, we will have every rule notified so that all of you can walk down that path with complete confidence with the government by your side,” telecom minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said recently.

CLSA finds markets vulnerable going into Budget as expectations rise,"Despite the bullish sentiment on Dalal Street leading up to the Union Budget, CLSA's 'Modi stocks' - poised to benefit from a favourable policy environment - have not experienced similar gains and have in fact stayed flat since the election verdict on June 4. The foreign brokerage's 'India Bull Bear Index' currently shows investors' sentiment at 92 percent bullishness, its highest ahead of any Union Budget in the past 15 years. According to CLSA, such an extreme sentiment reading coupled with stretched valuations make the domestic market setup extremely vulnerable going into the budget. Follow our live blog to catch all the updates After a significant 54 percent rally in the eight months leading up to the election results, Modi Stocks have stay remained flat, in stark contrast to other spaces which have risen by up to 12 percent. This stagnation is largely attributed to fears that elevated expectations from the budget are causing widespread disappointment across a large part of the market, the brokerage noted. Ahead of the election verdict on June 4, CLSA identified 54 companies that would have been direct beneficiaries of government's policies, with public sector undertakings (PSUs) making up half of these beneficiaries. These firms are from capex and infrastructure-linked sectors, PSUs or stocks of some corporate houses. The brokerage has named these as “Modi stocks,” since they were rallying based on prospects of the BJP coming back to power. Following the election results, when the BJP failed to cinch a clear majority by itself in the Lok Sabha, CLSA maintained only two of those stocks in its India focus portfolio: ONGC and Reliance Industries.

"ITR filing 2024: How tax harvesting can slash the tax payable, boost returns","It is July, an important month for individual taxpayers. For the financial year 2023-24, which corresponds to the assessment year 2024-25, the last date to file income tax returns is July 31. It is crucial for taxpayers to understand the importance of the due date and timely filing of tax returns. Here are some key aspects of filing the income tax return (ITR), the importance of adhering to the deadline, and the potential consequences of missing it. What is the difference between financial year and assessment year? Financial year is the period in which you earn income, running from April 1 to March 31—your tax return pertains to this year. The assessment year, on the other hand, is the year immediately following the financial year, during which the income earned in the financial year is assessed and taxed. For instance, for income earned between April 1, 2023, and March 31, 2024 (FY 2023-24), the assessment will be done in AY 2024-25. Also read: Moneycontrol's income tax calculator  What is the ITR? An income tax return is a declaration form that taxpayers submit to the income tax (I-T) department, detailing their income, expenses and other relevant financial information for a particular financial year. Filing an ITR allows the government to assess your tax liability and ensure that you have disclosed your earnings and paid the correct amount of taxes. What is the last date for filing ITR for FY 2023-24 or AY 2024-25? For FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25), the due date for filing your income tax return is July 31, 2024. It is essential to file your ITR before this deadline to avoid penalties and interest on delayed payments. Why must you file your ITR before July 31? Filing your ITR before the due date is crucial for several reasons: Avoid penalties and interest: Missing the deadline can result in penalties and interest on the outstanding tax amount. “Taxpayer would be liable to pay simple interest under Section 234A of the I-T (Income-tax) Act at the rate of 1 percent for every month or part of a month, commencing from the date immediately following the due date, i.e., July 31, to the actual date of furnishing of the return; or in case no return has been furnished,” said Suresh Surana, a practicing chartered accountant. Avoid late-filing fee: If you file the return after the due date, you will not only have to pay additional interest on due taxes but also a late filing fee. “Taxpayer would be additionally liable to pay late fees of Rs 5,000 under Section 234F if the return is furnished after the due date specified under Section 139(1). However, if the total income of the person does not exceed Rs 5 lakh, then such late filing fee shall be restricted to Rs 1,000,” said Surana. Timely refunds: During the financial year, you may have received income from multiple sources, and tax may have been deducted at source by the payer as stipulated by tax laws. However, if you are eligible for a tax refund, filing early ensures that you receive it promptly. No carry-forward of losses: Another crucial point to remember is that if you miss the deadline to file your ITR, you may not be able to carry forward losses (for instance, incurred on sale of stocks or mutual fund units) to future years. In other words, if you file a belated or updated return, you will not be allowed to carry forward losses for set-off against income in subsequent years. Also read: Salaried taxpayer? Know how to pick the right ITR form, avoid common errors Facilitate loan approvals: Timely ITR filing is often a requirement for loan approvals, as it serves as proof of your income.  Belated tax return If you miss filing your return by July 31, you can still file a belated return. This can be filed up to three months before the end of the relevant assessment year. So, if you miss filing the ITR for FY 2023-24 by July 31, 2024, you can file a belated return until December 31, 2024. However, as mentioned above, filing a belated return attracts a penalty, and the taxpayer may lose certain benefits, such as the ability to carry forward losses. Updated ITR An updated return is a revised ITR filed by a taxpayer to correct any mistakes or omissions in the original or belated return. This option allows taxpayers to rectify errors or include additional information that were initially missed. Updated returns can usually be filed within two years from the end of the relevant assessment year. So, for the financial year 2023-24, the relevant assessment year is 2024-25. Therefore, an updated return for FY 2023-24 can be filed until March 31, 2027. However, the catch is that an updated return should not result in a reduction of tax liability—in other words, you cannot reduce the income disclosed in the original return and thereby end up with a lower tax liability by filing an updated return. Filing an updated return can help avoid penalties or legal consequences for inaccurate or incomplete original filings or when you have missed disclosing certain income in the original ITR.

Byju's founder faces reckoning as startup implodes,"Byju Raveendran, an Indian mathematics whiz who soared from teacher to startup billionaire before his education-technology company imploded this year, now faces his biggest test. The future of Raveendran's eponymous Byju's online coaching firm rests with India's courts after the county's biggest startup, once loved by global investors who valued it at $22 billion, crashed below $2 billion in valuation. The 44-year-old founder last week lost control of the company as a tribunal kick-started an insolvency process. Accused of ""financial mismanagement and compliance issues"", the son of a family of teachers from a small village in south India faces a reckoning that will test the ingenuity that made him a poster child for India's startups. His formerly high-flying company was eventually brought low when it could not pay $19 million in sponsorship dues to India's cricket federation, prompting a tribunal to suspend Byju's board and make Raveendran report to a court-appointed restructuring expert. An appeals tribunal is expected to hold a hearing on Monday on whether Byju's insolvency process should be quashed after the former billionaire argued in court his company is solvent and that insolvency could shut it down and cost the jobs of 27,000 staff, including teachers. Insolvency also would not bode well for Byju's backers, such as Dutch technology investor Prosus. Raveendran denies the allegations of mismanagement and wrongdoing at his firm, which has in recent months faced lawsuits over unpaid loans and boardroom battles with foreign investors that went public. Potential insolvency is a dramatic turn of events for an entrepreneur described by one person who has worked with him as an extremely passionate and goal-oriented person who might adopt ""an abrasive approach"" in a crisis. Raveendran presented a ""suave, nice and polished"" image, appearing to heed advice, but ""eventually there was a trust deficit"", said another executive who quit last year as a Byju's senior vice president. ""He said things are improving, don't worry, we have the money,"" the former executive said. Raveendran and a Byju's spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment. BYJU'S DOWNFALL: 'OUR FAIR SHARE OF MISTAKES' An engineer by training, he started Byju's in 2011 with physical classes after friends urged him to go into teaching. Raveendran, who aced a premier Indian management exam ""with a score of 100 percentile, not once but twice"", according to the company website, started what would become his empire with his wife Divya Gokulnath, 38, a former student of his. In education-obsessed India, Raveendran hit gold by offering online teaching programs priced from $100 to $300. He got a mammoth boost when the COVID-19 pandemic sent students indoors. At the height of his fame in 2021, he and his wife had a net worth of $4 billion, Forbes reckoned. Now all that is in tatters. Behind the reversal of Byju's meteoric success, say executives and advisers who worked with Raveendran, is that he overruled associates and expanded the business through expensive acquisitions, splurging on marketing and being slow to address problems such as sales agents adopting aggressive tactics to mis-sell courses that damaged the company's reputation. With the backing of investors like General Atlantic, Prosus and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's philanthropy venture, Raveendran spent millions on acquisitions, and the company says it has 150 million students in over 100 countries. ""While growing fast, as I've accepted multiple times, we've made our fair share of mistakes"", Raveendran told an interviewer last year at the World Economic Forum in Davos. As he battled crises, the CEO also said decisions to lay off some of its then-50,000 employees and slash branding expenses would help strengthen loss-making Byju's and turn its cashflow positive. ""Every country needs a Byju's,"" he said.

Suzuki sees India’s automobile market growing fivefold by 2047,"India’s car market is on track to reach 20 million units by 2047, helped by promising growth in battery electric vehicles, Suzuki Motor Corp. Executive Vice President Kenichi Ayukawa said. First, the goal is for Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., the Japanese carmaker’s subsidiary, to grab 50% market share by 2030, from around 40% for the fiscal year through March. “We’re confident that the Indian market will expand in the mid to long term,” Ayukawa said in an interview. The emergence of India as an economic powerhouse and its expanding middle class present a clear opportunity for the Hamamatsu-based manufacturer, which has been active in the South Asian nation since 1983 and has found success as the top-selling automaker with models such as Swift and Brezza. In order to keep its lead, Suzuki plans to introduce its first-ever EV in India, as well as in Europe, next year after exhibiting its mass production model at the upcoming auto expo in India in January, according to Ayukawa. “We’ll develop products, invest and expand our network,” Ayukawa said. A total of 4.2 million passenger vehicles were sold in India in the fiscal year ended in March, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. To put that number — and Ayukawa’s prediction — in perspective, 3.1 million passenger cars were sold in the US last year, while Europe saw 15 million in unit sales. China is the world’s largest automobile market with 26 million passenger vehicle sales, according to the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers. Although Suzuki’s planned eVX is a premium electric vehicle, the carmaker will also roll out more affordable and compact models with lighter batteries, according to Ayukawa. Suzuki is targeting 15% of its sales in India to be EVs by 2030, he added. “India faces environmental issues so I think EVs will grow to an extent,” Ayukawa said. Although people are paying more for cars more than they used to, “India remains a price-conscious market,” he added. Even so, car buyers are starting to show greater appetite for crossovers and sport-utility vehicles, according to Ayukawa. Competition is tougher in that segment because it’s a “strong area for Tata and Mahindra,” he said. Tata Motors Ltd., India’s third-biggest carmaker, has already taken the lead in with fully-electric variants of its popular Tiago and Nexon models, and expects its EV business to reach profitability by early 2026. Suzuki will focus on models that can be used for everyday needs, which will require development of new types of batteries, according to Ayukawa. In the future, Suzuki may embark on domestic production of cells in the next 5 to 10 years, he added. As for collaboration in India with Toyota Motor Corp., which forged a strategic partnership with Suzuki in 2019 through a stake of about 5%, Suzuki will likely focus on smaller cars while Toyota will take the lead on bigger models, Ayukawa said. Toyota’s EV technology will also bolster Suzuki’s product development, he added. “We will learn basic know-how from Toyota and gradually make it our own,” Ayukawa said. Suzuki also sees potential in cars powered by compressed natural gas, which is cheaper than gasoline in India, according to Ayukawa. Maruti Suzuki sold 483,000 CNG cars in the latest fiscal period, up 47% from a year earlier. Although Suzuki plans to start operating four plants that convert methane from cow manure into fuel for cars that currently run on CNG, there are challenges ahead, such as monetizing the organic fertilizer that remains after manufacturing the fuel at a large scale, Ayukawa said.

Tariff hikes will strengthen the telecom sector in the long term: Jio Platform's Anshuman Thakur,"The recent round of telecom tariff hikes will strengthen the Indian telecom sector in the longer term but may result in some transient impact on consumer behaviour, Jio Platforms’ Senior Vice President Anshuman Thakur said in the post-earning presentation on July 19. Jio recently announced its new unlimited plans effective July 3, 2024. These new plans imply a tariff increase of 13 -25 percent compared to previous plans. “As expected, other operators have also raised tariffs. Overall, industry tariff levels have gone up. There may be some transient impact, but in longer terms, this is going to be good for the overall telecom industry and help build a premier digital society and strengthen the sector,” Thakur said. ALSO READ: Jio Platforms Q1 profit increases 12% to Rs 5,698 crore Jio’s 5G services is free to users who subscribe to certain plans at no additional cost. “This is to encourage 5G consumption on the network and people to adopt more 5G,” he said. The senior executive said Jio has a “very good spectrum” bank that fulfils requirements across Jio's services, including 4G, 5G mobile, and home broadband. “We were very focused on acquiring more spectrum only in cases where we had seen demand go up, the data consumption going up and therefore, to ensure that the customer service never suffers, we added more spectrum in Bihar and West Bengal in 1800 MHz band at total costs of Rs 974 crore. So we were very focused on looking at spectrum, which we needed just to ensure that our customers always get the best offering, he said. Jio’s spectrum footprint across bands is now at 26,801 MHz. He said Jio is the only telco running 5G across the low band [700 Mhz], mid-band [3300 Mhz and high-band [26 Ghz]. “This gives us unique advantages like carrier aggregation and standalone network.” Thakur said that Jio has been making inroads in key verticals in the enterprise space and has started displacing competition. “We are now successfully displacing competition wherever we are getting an opportunity. Enterprise deals tend to have longer tenure. So we have to wait for opportunities where these come up for renewal and then make our entry,” he said, adding that Jio has expanded its wallet share beyond connectivity. Jio is also building a partner ecosystem to tap into enterprise opportunities, especially in specialised sectors where access through the partner ecosystem is easier and faster. He revealed that BFSI remains a strong vertical for Jio's enterprise business. ""We have tied up with some BFSI clients to do more beyond connectivity and some enterprise offering.” Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

"UltraTech Cement's expansion, efficiency boosts to help lower costs by Rs 300 per tonne","UltraTech Cement is poised to reduce cost by Rs 300 per tonne over the next three quarters, thanks to an expanding network of plants, decreasing lead distance and other reductions. In a post-earnings call on July 19, India's largest cement manufacturer's management highlighted its strategic initiatives to enhance cost efficiency. Ultratech Cement reported a significant reduction in lead distance from 400 kilometres to 385 kilometres, which has resulted in cost savings of approximately Rs 45 per ton of cement. This improvement is crucial as logistics costs represent a major expenditure in cement production, said CFO Atul Daga. The management anticipates further reductions in the lead distance as they expand their network from 59 to over 70 plant locations, which will contribute to additional cost savings and operational efficiencies.

They completed an open offer to acquire a 54 percent stake in Black White Cement in the UAE, reinforcing their position in the white cement and putty markets. The company also continues to lead in grey cement in the UAE. Domestically, UltraTech is ramping up its Waste Heat Recovery Systems (WHRS) capacity, with 23 megawatts commissioned this quarter, bringing the total to 301 megawatts. The focus on increasing WHRS capacity and renewable energy usage aligns with their strategy to reduce power costs and enhance sustainability. Looking ahead, UltraTech Cement's management expressed optimism about the business outlook. Despite typical monsoon-related fluctuations expected in Q2, the overall sentiment remains positive, with strong demand anticipated in rural markets. The company is confident that the momentum will pick up in Q3 as construction activity ramps up. With ongoing investments in infrastructure and operational efficiencies, UltraTech is well-positioned to capitalize on market opportunities and sustain growth in the coming quarters, the management noted.

UltraTech's 23% stake in India Cements seen as promising market investment: CFO Atul Daga,"Picking up a large stake in India Cements is purely a non-controlling financial investment, said Ultratech Cement management on July 19. Last month, UltraTech snapped up a big chunk of India Cements by acquiring a 23 percent non-controlling stake in the struggling rival for around Rs 1,900 crore via block deals. Initially, UltraTech bought 6.02 crore ICL shares, or a 19.4 percent stake. Following this, the board met again and approved the acquisition of an additional 3.4 percent, or 1.04 crore equity shares, for up to Rs 285 apiece. ""We found this as a good opportunity to buy in and the way markets are, this should prove to be a good investment,"" said Ultratech Cement CFO Atul Daga in a post-earnings conference call.

Vedanta Resources pays $246 million dues to help revive operations at Zambian copper mine,"UK-based Vedanta Resources, parent of India's Vedanta, has settled dues worth $245.75 million to help revive operations in Konkola copper mines (KCM) in Zambia as part of a deal to take back the mines, the Indian miner said on Friday. The miner, owned by billionaire Anil Agarwal, had in November 2023 regained control of the copper mines and smelter, which the Zambian administration had seized in 2019, but needed to pay creditors of the mines to revive operations. Vedanta Resources gained control of KCM's assets following a five-year legal battle after the former Zambian President Edgar Lungu accused the company of failing to invest to expand copper production and seized its assets. The UK-based company will still need to raise an additional $1 billion to revive the KCM's mining operations and invest in advancing the Konkola deep mining project, which holds one of the richest copper deposits in the world, as per a Reuters report from early July. The Zambian government owns a 20% stake in KCM through ZCCM, a mining investment company, while Vedanta Resources owns the rest. Last month, Anil Agarwal said Vedanta Resources is looking to reduce its debt by $3 billion over the next three years, as the company grapples with mounting debt and a host of rating downgrades since last year.

Citigroup sees India luring $100 billion in foreign investment,"Foreign investors will likely deploy as much as $100 billion in India this fiscal year, drawn to high-tech manufacturing, infrastructure and climate-change projects in the world’s most-populous country, according to a Citigroup Inc. banker. Companies working to help India meet its net-zero goals will be among the beneficiaries of the foreign capital flows, according to K Balasubramanian, head of corporate banking for Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. “Climate transition is playing out in a big way, likely triggering a bout of foreign fund inflows,” Balasubramanian, known as Bala, said in an interview in Mumbai. India’s government aims to attract $110 billion a year in foreign direct investment over the next seven years as the South Asian nation draws investors looking to diversify away from China. That compares with an annual average of more than $70 billion over the last five years. Bala said capital is flowing into sustainable energy creation strategies like solar, hydrogen and ammonia. On the energy consumption side, electric vehicles are the “real big story,” he said. “Every formidable company is nurturing plans to enter the next generation iteration on electric mobility,” Bala said.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has cast himself as a climate champion, and India has made significant investments in clean energy, adding more than 100 gigawatts of capacity in the last 10 years. The country has pledged to install 500 GW of non-fossil fuel energy by the end of the decade, and aims to secure $1 trillion in investments in solar power to meet its 2070 net-zero pledge. India has a 181 billion rupees ($2.2 billion) incentive program to manufacture electric-vehicle batteries in the country. Reliance Industries Ltd., JSW Neo Energy Ltd., and Ola Electric Mobility Pvt. are among the companies selected to produce battery capacity and avail incentives under the program. Apart from climate transition, India’s forays into electronics and infrastructure-related manufacturing are gaining prominence with investors abroad, Bala said. “Capital will come to wherever there are pockets of opportunity in terms of production cost advantage,” Bala said. “Then skill and value addition will be the key drivers for such investments.” India is attracting new groups of investors, according to Bala. Middle-eastern sovereign wealth funds are big backers of energy creation projects, while US investors are drawn to technology and consumption-focused companies. European firms invest in high-end tech, and capital from North Asian countries is making its way to India, Bala said. “In Japan itself, 1,600 companies have identified plans of getting into India, as distributors or suppliers to large companies,” Bala said. The New York-based bank has been ramping up its relationships to become the “first port of call,” for foreign investment, Bala said. These include the US-India corridor, where it gets a majority of the business, he said. The bank is also strong in Germany, France and in the Nordic region, and is spending a lot of time in Taiwan, Bala said.

Demand for creation of new NBFC-PSL category in Budget to boost MSME sector,"The creation of a new category of Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) dedicated to priority sector lending (PSL) to support the growth of MSMEs features among the key demands by business leaders in the forthcoming Union Budget. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget in Parliament on Tuesday. Shachindra Nath, Founder & MD of UGRO Capital Ltd, urged the government to address specific challenges faced by NBFCs that cater to the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). He called for the establishment of NBFC-PSL, which would focus at least 85 per cent of their assets under management (AUM) on the priority sector. ""Creating an NBFC-PSL category will foster a more inclusive and resilient financial ecosystem for MSMEs,"" Nath told PTI. He said loans from banks to NBFCs for onward lending to MSMEs should be classified as ""PSL loans"", with current caps removed. Nath also proposed reintroducing the Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme and expanding it to include term loans. This would provide a portfolio guarantee for the purchase of bonds or commercial papers with a rating of ""AA"" or below issued by NBFCs-MSMEs by public sector banks, facilitating greater funding for small and medium NBFCs. He called for harmonising of the SARFAESI Act limit to enhance recovery processes for smaller loan defaults by reducing the cap for credit eligible under this act from Rs 20 lakh to Rs 1 lakh for NBFCs, similar to banks. ""This will also improve financial health and boost confidence among lenders and investors,"" Nath said. Umesh Revankar, Executive Vice Chairman at Shriram Finance Ltd, stated that the Union government is expected to maintain its focus on infrastructure development and the MSME sector in the upcoming budget. He said continued emphasis on infrastructure development, particularly logistics, will play a crucial role in making manufacturing in India more affordable and globally competitive. ""Improvements in logistics are likely to provide India with a significant advantage on the international stage,"" said Revankar. The Engineering Export Promotion Council (EEPC India) has also urged the government to revive the interest subvention scheme for exporters in its pre-budget recommendation. EEPC India Chairman Arun Kumar Garodia has emphasised on the scheme's importance, especially with rising interest rates. He called for restoring the 3 per cent subvention rate for specific tariff lines and a 5 per cent rate for MSME exporters across all product categories. The council represents nearly 9,500 member companies (over 60 per cent MSMEs), contributing 25 per cent of total exports.

Union Budget 2024,"After being denied any tax sops in the interim Budget 2024 announced in February ahead of the general elections, individual, middle-class tax-payers are now pinning their hopes on the full-year Budget to be unveiled on July 23. Their wishlist includes lower tax rates, higher basic exemption limit as well as standard deduction. However, financial experts feel the government may announce a few tax tweaks but the benefits will be largely limited to the new, minimal exemptions tax regime. Hike basic exemption threshold to Rs 5 lakh The basic exemption limits – income thresholds below which no tax is payable – under the old as well as new tax regimes are Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 3 lakh, respectively.  The expectation is that the limit under new tax regime will be raised to Rs 5 lakh. “This will neither greatly impact the government’s tax revenue collections nor shrink the tax base, but it will help those in the higher tax brackets reduce their tax outgo. My assessment is that those in the tax slab of Rs 15-20 lakh could save Rs 50,000-60,000 if this move is announced,” says Mayank Mohanka, chartered accountant and founder-director of TaxAaraam India, a tax consultancy firm. Also read: Union Budget 2024: Raise senior citizens' basic exemption limit to Rs 10 lakh, hike health premium deduction Introduce an additional tax slab of Rs 15-20 lakh This demand is high on the wishlist of many taxpayers and financial experts. “Under the new tax regime, taxable incomes of up to Rs 15 lakh attract a tax rate of 20 percent, and beyond Rs 15 lakh, the tax rate is 30 percent. A tax bracket of 25 percent does not exist. So, there’s scope to introduce this additional bracket for Rs 15-20 lakh incomes. The 30 percent tax rate will then be applicable for taxable incomes of over Rs 20 lakh,” says Pankaj Mathpal, Founder, Optima Money Managers, a financial advisory firm. Extend HRA or home loan interest to the new regime The key hurdles to the shift to the new tax regime include availability of house rent allowance (HRA) and home interest tax benefits under the old tax regime. These, rather than section 80C benefits, act as incentives to stay on in the old regime. “Rental accommodation is a basic necessity. If permitted under the new regime, over 70 percent of taxpayers sticking to the old tax regime will shift to the new regime. The government should either allow HRA or home loan interest deduction under the minimal exemptions regime,” says Mohanka. Increase equity LTCG tax limit from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2 lakh Since the financial year 2018-19, long-term capital gains made on sale of equity shares or mutual fund units in excess of Rs 1 lakh in a year attract a tax of 10 percent. “It’s been over six years since the threshold was set. The government could consider raising the limit to Rs 2 lakh,” says Mathpal. ‘Speculative business’ definition for F&O could make a comeback While individual taxpayers are expecting a host of positive news from the Budget, some need to be prepared for setbacks too. “There is a sense that retail participation in futures and options (F&O) trading needs to be reined in. In our experience, we have seen nearly 80 percent of taxpayers making losses in this segment. There is a possibility that the government could, once again, define F&O trading as speculative business. At present, they can offset F&O losses against their business, interest, dividend or house property income, which cannot be done if it is termed speculative,” says Mohanka. In this case, they will be able to set off F&O losses only against gains made while trading in this segment.

Air India rolls out VRS for non-flying staff ahead of Vistara merger,"Air India has rolled out a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) along with a voluntary separation scheme for its non-flying permanent staff ahead of the merger of Vistara with it, according to sources. The VRS scheme is open to employees who have completed five years of service with the company while the voluntary separation scheme (VSS) has been offered to employees with less than five years of service at the airline, they said. Air India confirmed the developments without sharing the specific details of the twin schemes that the airline rolled out on Wednesday giving the aspirants a one-month window to apply for VRS/VSS. This is the third time Air India has come out with a voluntary retirement scheme for its permanent employees since its privatisation two-and-a-half years ago. Tata Group took over the reins of Air India in January 2022. Earlier this month, sources in the know had told PTI that the merger is expected to impact around 600 employees from the two airlines. Tata Group-owned- loss-making full-service carriers -- Air India and Vistara -- together have more than 23,000 employees. Similar schemes are expected to be announced by Vistara as well soon as after completion of the fitment exercise and assigning of roles some redundancies are bound to creep in, said a source, adding that Air India is trying to accommodate some of the redundant employees with the Air India group or within the Tata Group companies as well. Vistara is a joint venture between Singapore Airlines and Tata Group. Once the merger is complete, Singapore Airlines will have a 25.1 per cent stake in Air India. The fitment exercise -- which involves the evaluation of the roles and responsibilities of staff of both airlines -- in the run-up to the merger has been going on for the past few months. The exercise takes into account an individual's prior experience, performance and other factors. As part of consolidating its airline business, Tata Group is also merging Air India Express and AIX Connect (formerly AirAsia India).

Expect domestic two-wheeler sales to reach peak levels of FY19 latest by Q1 FY26: Bajaj Auto,"Two-wheeler sales in India are expected to grow around 6-8 per cent this fiscal and could reach the peak level of 2018-19 either in the fourth quarter or the beginning of next financial year, a top official of Bajaj Auto said on Tuesday. The rising commodity prices, specially natural rubber, have forced the company to increase prices in beginning of this month. ”The market sentiment is quite positive in both rural and urban areas. Our expectation is that the two-wheeler market should grow around 6-8 per cent this year,” Bajaj Auto Executive Director Rakesh Sharma told reporters in an earnings conference. When asked by when the industry could touch the peak sales achieved in 2018-19, he said, ”If not Q4 of this year, by Q1 of next year we should be able to breach the watermark of FY19.” In 2018-19, domestic two-wheeler sales were at 2.12 crore units. In FY24, domestic two-wheeler sales were at 1.8 crore units, according to Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) data. One of the key factors driving growth of two-wheeler sales is the bounce back of retail financing, he said. ”Things have been on an upswing in retail finance with 75 per cent of two-wheeler purchases are getting financed today as compared to 65 per cent around the same time last year,” he added. When asked about impact of rising commodity prices, Sharma said, ”We have taken price hikes on July 1 in both domestic and internal markets. The impact of this is around 2-3 per cent.” Currently it is at a manageable level, he added.
