The Foxconn group company was already in trouble after the exit of three independent directors in the past three months.\\u00a0InterGlobe Aviation chairman Venkataramani Sumantran, Sify Technologies cofounder Ramaraj R and former IT and telecom secretary Aruna Sundararajan cited a lack of clarity in the company's direction as the reason for their departures. Bharat FIH has struggled to diversify beyond Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi, failing to compete effectively with rivals like home-grown Dixon Technologies, which has benefitted from the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, the report said. Moneycontrol couldn\\u2019t verify the report independently. The company\\u2019s inability to pivot quickly to other sectors exacerbated its woes, particularly as Xiaomi faces regulatory challenges in India, the report said. Foxconn is expanding its India operations, notably in iPhone production, through other subsidiaries. However, Bharat FIH has not benefitted much from this expansion. Bharat FIH has been hit by Xiaomi diversifying its manufacturing partners. It has promoted the firm to consolidate operations at its Sriperumbudur facility, which now focuses on diverse segments such as telecom equipment, EV components and displays. \\u00a0\\n       \",\n          \"Welspun One has raised Rs 2,275 crore from investors for its second fund and would use the capital to develop warehousing properties. Welspun One, an integrated fund and development management platform, on Monday announced the successful closure of its second fund totalling Rs 2,275 crores, inclusive of co-investment commitments. This marks the largest domestic fundraise in this space, the company claimed. The capital was sourced from a diverse pool of about 800 Limited Partners (LPs) or investors, including high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth individuals, family offices, corporates, and domestic institutions. Welspun One's second fund has already committed nearly 40 per cent of its investible capital across four investments. It expects to commit the remaining capital over the next 3-4 quarters. This will add 8 million square feet to Welspun One's existing portfolio of 10 million square feet, taking their aggregate portfolio to around 18 million square feet, entailing a total project outlay of around USD 1 billion. Welspun One's focus for fund 2 is on new-age warehousing assets, such as urban distribution centres, cold chain, agro logistics, and port and airport-based logistics, the statement said. Balkrishan Goenka, Chairman of Welspun World, said, \\\"Our commitment to advancing critical logistics infrastructure is in perfect alignment with India's strategic objective of reducing logistics costs from 14 per cent to 8 per cent, thereby enhancing the global competitiveness of our industries.\\\" By making investments in essential infrastructure, he said the fund aims to streamline logistics operations and stimulate industrial growth. Anshul Singhal, Managing Director, Welspun One, said, \\\"Embarking on the exploration of new-age warehousing assets represents an exciting journey for us at Welspun One. Our progress has been remarkable, having successfully established a well-capitalized platform poised to achieve an AUM of over USD 1 billion.\\\" Welspun One had raised Rs 500 crore in its first fund. Till date, Welspun One's first fund is fully committed with six investments, aggregating to a development potential of 7.2 million square feet across 300 acres of land in five cities. Currently, about 50 per cent of this is already delivered, with the remaining 50 per cent scheduled for delivery over the next 4-6 quarters. The portfolio includes clients such as Tata Croma, Delhivery, FM Logistics, Asian Paints, and Ecom Express, amongst others. Welspun One is the warehousing platform of the USD 5 billion global conglomerate Welspun World, which is one of India's fastest-growing multinationals with a leadership position in line pipes, home textiles, infrastructure, advanced textiles, and flooring solutions.\\n       \",\n          \"Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited (ZEEL) on June 17 said that it has appointed Mukund Galgali as the acting chief financial officer (CFO) of the company after its current CFO Rohit Kumar Gupta decided to step down from his position due to personal reasons. Galgali has been with the ZEE group for more than 17 years and is currently leading the Commercial & Strategic Initiatives of the company. He will take charge as the interim CFO from June 19, 2024. Galgali, who is a Chartered Accountant, and a Company Secretary, has over 27 years of Global Financial and Corporate leadership experience. Zee mentioned that as a member of the leadership team, he has been providing strategic consulting advice on business planning and performance, regulatory and tax implications on business, process innovations and management controls etc. to improve business efficiency and value creation for shareholders. Meanwhile, shares of ZEE on June 17 closed nearly 2 percent lower at Rs\\u00a0160.85 apiece on BSE. Recently, the media company has announced a slew of measures to cut costs and reduce losses in its business, including cutting 15 percent of its workforce. It has announced a remodel of the company's leadership structure. In the recent fourth quarter, Zee reported a profit of Rs 13.35 crore against a loss a year ago, helped by strong demand for advertising and a fall in expenses. Domestic advertising revenue for the quarter rose nearly 11% year-on-year (YoY), driven by the continued recovery in the macro advertising environment and spending pickup by FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) clients.\\n       \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
